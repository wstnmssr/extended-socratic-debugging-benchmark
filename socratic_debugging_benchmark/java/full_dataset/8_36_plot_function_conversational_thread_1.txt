<problem>
Write a function `myFunc(int len) -> List<Integer>` that generates a list of `len` integers. The element at each position 'i' in the list should be computed as `i * 6 + rand.nextInt(len) + 1`. Before calling the function, use 42 as the seed for the random number generator by calling `rand.setSeed(42)`. Assume that `len` is a non-negative integer.

## Example Cases:
```
myFunc(10) => Arrays.asList(2, 7, 17, 22, 28, 33, 38, 51, 50, 64)
myFunc(7) => Arrays.asList(4, 7, 13, 19, 26, 32, 41)
myFunc(5) => Arrays.asList(5, 7, 17, 20, 29)
myFunc(3) => Arrays.asList(2, 7, 14)
myFunc(1) => Arrays.asList(1)
```

</bug_code>
<bug_desc>
The function has a syntax error on line 6. Defining a function inside of the built-in function `map` using `def` is invalid.
</bug_desc>
<bug_fixes>
Replace `def yOf(x):` with `x ->` on line 6.
After line 5 insert the following:
```java
public static int yOf(int x, int len, Random rand) {
    return x * 6 + rand.nextInt(len) + 1;
}
```
Replace `map(def yOf(x):  x * 6 + rand.nextInt(len) + 1,  range(len))` with `map(x -> yOf(x, len, rand),  range(len))` on line 6.
After line 6 insert the following:
```java
public static int yOf(int x) {
    return x * 6 + rand.nextInt(len) + 1;
}
```
Replace `map(def yOf(x):  x * 6 + rand.nextInt(len) + 1,  range(len))` with `map(x -> yOf(x),  range(len))`.

The student is very familiar with basic programming concepts and wants to go above and beyond by solving a problem using the `map` function which the student is still learning how to use.

User: Hey, I learned recently about the use of `map` in Python and I'm trying to use it to solve this problem. I am stuck though. Can you help me out?
Assistant: Certainly. Can you describe what you know about the `map` function so far with an example if possible?
	<alt>Certainly. Can you describe what your code does on line 5?
	<alt>Certainly. Do you know what the `map` function takes in as parameters?
User: So I learned that the `map` function takes in a function and an iterable. The `map` function applies the function to each element in the iterable provided and returns an iterable. In this case, I am passing `def yOf(x):  x * 6 + rand.nextInt(len) + 1` as the function and `range(len)` as the iterable. I really think I can solve this problem with `map`.
Assistant: Ah good explanation. When you try to run your code what do you observe in the terminal?
	<alt>Good explanation. So what is the specific issue that you have?
	<alt>Good explanation. Where can you learn more about the `map` function and its use?
User: So when I try to run my code, it throws a syntax error on line 5.
Assistant: Can you explain to me what the `def` reserved word in Python does?
	<alt>Can you describe what `def yOf(x):   x * 6  + rand.nextInt(len) + 1` does?
	<alt>It looks like you are trying to define the function `yOf(x)` inside of the `map` function call. Do you think that's supported by Python syntax?
User: `def` stands for define and it creates a function in Python to be used later on in the code.
Assistant: It looks like you are trying to define the function `yOf(x)` inside of the `map` function call. Do you think that's supported by Python syntax?
User: I guess not from the looks of it. Maybe I should define my function outside of the `map` call?
	<alt>It seems to be the case. Not really sure though what to do though.
Assistant: Let's try defining the function `yOf(x)` before using it in `map`. Where do you think it is best to define your function?
User: Maybe after line 4? Inside of `myFunc` so that it is within scope?
	<alt>Probably before `myFunc` so on line 3 I can insert my function definition for `yOf(x)`.
	<alt>Not really sure.
Assistant: Sounds good. Let's try it. Are you planning to declare a function inside of another function?
User: Yes. It's called a nested function! Let me edit my code. Ah I see that `x` is not defined, but I do define it on line 5.
<code>
import java.util.*;
public class PlotFunction {
    public static List<Integer> myFunc(int len) {
        Random rand = new Random();
        rand.setSeed(42);
        List<Integer> y = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
            y.add(i * 6 + rand.nextInt(len) + 1);
        }
        return y;
    }
}
</code>
Assistant: What is the scope of the parameters declared for the function `yOf`?
	<alt>Where can `x` be used?
User: Oh the scope is only line 6. I see it. I don't need `x` on line 6 since I am the `map` function takes care of passing each element in `range(len)` to `yOf` as the parameter `x`. Let me edit my code.
<code>
import java.util.*;
public class PlotFunction {
    public static List<Integer> myFunc(int len) {
        Random rand = new Random();
        rand.setSeed(42);
        List<Integer> y = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
            y.add(i * 6 + rand.nextInt(len) + 1);
        }
        return y;
    }
}
</code>
Assistant: Good. Have you tried your code for all examples?
User: Yes it does! Thank you for your help today!
Assistant: You're welcome! Let me know if you have any other questions!
