<problem>
Write a function that computes the area of a circle. You will name your function `area_circle(radius: float) -> float`. It has one parameter, the radius of the circle, radius. `The area_circle` function will return the area of the circle.

## Example Cases:
```
area_circle(1.0) => 3.141
area_circle(2.5) => 19.634
area_circle(3.6) => 40.715
area_circle(4.1) => 52.810
area_circle(7.0) => 153.938
area_circle(-2.0) => 0
```
</problem>
<bug_code>
1. import math
2.def area_circle(radius):
3.    if radius < 0:
4.        return 0
5.    return math.pi * radius ** radius
</bug_code>
<bug_desc>
On line 3, the function raises the radius to the power of the radius instead of squaring it. As a result, the function does not compute the circle area correctly.
</bug_desc>
<bug_fixes>
Change the return statement on line 4 to `math.pi * radius * radius`
Change the return statement on line 4 to `math.pi * radius **2`

User: Help! I'm stuck!
Assistant: Okay, do you have any ideas what the problem is?
	<alt>Are any of the test cases passing?
	<alt>Recheck the instructions, do you think anything is missing?
User: No, I don't know what's wrong.
	<alt>The first test case is passing, but the second one is failing.
Assistant: Okay, let's start by looking at the test cases, does the one on line 8 pass?
	<alt>Check the instructions, did you skip any steps?
	<alt>What exactly is this function designed to do?
User: Yes, the first test case passes, but the second one fails.
Assistant: Okay, the code is running, so let's start by looking at your function. Which line do you do your calculations on?
	<alt>That's interesting, why do you think the first test case is passing?
	<alt>What is the radius of the circle in the first test case that is passing?
	<alt>What is the radius of the circle in the first test case that is failing?
	<alt>Look at the if-statement on line 3, do you see any problems with it?
User: I calculate the area on line 5.
Assistant: Look carefully at that line, can you tell me exactly what the code there does?
	<alt>First, let's make sure that the radius we are inputting is okay, do you see any problems on line 3 with the if-statement?
	<alt>What is the formula for calculating the area of a circle?
	<alt>What is the python operator for raising one value to the power of another?
	<alt>What is the python operator for multiplying two numbers?
	<alt>Look carefully at that line, can you tell me exactly what the code there is supposed to do?
User: That's where the area of the circle is calculated.
Assistant: What's the formula for calculating that?
	<alt>What is the python operator for raising one value to the power of another?
	<alt>What is the python operator for multiplying two numbers?
	<alt>Walk me through that line, what does the first variable represent?
User: Pi times the radius of the circle squared.
	<alt>Oh! I'm not squaring the radius, I'm multiplying it times itself!
Assistant: Very good, so let's check that part, do you have Pi in the line?
	<alt>What is the python operator for raising one value to the power of another?
	<alt>What is the python operator for multiplying two numbers?
	<alt>Walk me through that line, what does the first variable represent?
User: Yes, that's the math.pi part.
Assistant: Very good, and do you have the radius in there?
	<alt>What do you multiply pi by?
	<alt>Are you multiplying pi by the correct value?
User: Yes, that's the radius variable.
	<alt>I'm not squaring it!
Assistant: What are you supposed to do with the radius?
	<alt>What is the python operator for raising one value to the power of another?
	<alt>Did you square the radius?
	<alt>How do you square a variable?
User: I'm supposed to square it.
Assistant: How do you square a number in Python?
	<alt>What is the python operator for raising one value to the power of another?
	<alt>Did you square the radius?
User: It's ** with a 2.
	<alt>I'm raising it to itself, not squaring it!
Assistant: Look at that line again, are you squaring the value?
User: No! I'm raising it to itself. I'll fix it.
<code>
1. import math
2.def area_circle(radius):
3.    if radius < 0:
4.        return 0
5.    return math.pi * radius ** 2
</code>
Assistant: Does it run correctly now?
User: Yes! It's passing all the test cases! Thanks!
