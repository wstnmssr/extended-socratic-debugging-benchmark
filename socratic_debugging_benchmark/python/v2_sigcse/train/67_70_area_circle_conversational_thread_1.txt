<problem>
Write a function that computes the area of a circle. You will name your function `area_circle(radius: float) -> float`. It has one parameter, the radius of the circle, radius. `The area_circle` function will return the area of the circle.

## Example Cases:
```
area_circle(1.0) => 3.141
area_circle(2.5) => 19.634
area_circle(3.6) => 40.715
area_circle(4.1) => 52.810
area_circle(7.0) => 153.938
area_circle(-2.0) => 0
```
</problem>
<bug_code>
1. import math
2.def area_circle(radius):
3.    if radius < 0:
4.        return 0
5.    return math.pi * radius ** radius
</bug_code>
<bug_desc>
On line 3, the function raises the radius to the power of the radius instead of squaring it. As a result, the function does not compute the circle area correctly.
</bug_desc>
<bug_fixes>
Change the return statement on line 4 to `math.pi * radius * radius`
Change the return statement on line 4 to `math.pi * radius **2`

User: Help! I'm stuck!
Assistant: Okay, do you have any ideas what the problem is?
	<alt>Are any of the test cases passing?
	<alt>Recheck the instructions, do you think anything is missing?
User: No, I don't know what's wrong.
	<alt>The first test case is passing, but the second one is failing.
Assistant: Okay, let's start by looking at the test cases, does the one on line 8 pass?
	<alt>Check the instructions, did you skip any steps?
	<alt>What exactly is this function designed to do?
User: Yes, the first test case passes, but the second one fails.
Assistant: What is the radius of the circle in the first test case that is passing?
	<alt>That's interesting, why do you think the first test case is passing?
	<alt>Okay, the code is running, so let's start by looking at your function. Which line do you do your calculations on?
	<alt>What is the radius of the circle in the first test case that is failing?
	<alt>What is the formula for calculating the area of a circle?
	<alt>Look at the if-statement on line 3, do you see any problems with it?
User: The radius of the first test case that is passing is one.
Assistant: What is the radius of the first test case that is failing?
	<alt>What is the formula for calculating the area of a circle?
	<alt>That's interesting, why do you think the first test case is passing?
	<alt>Okay, the code is running, so let's start by looking at your function. Which line do you do your calculations on?
User: It's 2.5.
Assistant: What is the formula for calculating the area of a circle?
	<alt>That's interesting, do you think there is anything significant about those numbers?
	<alt>Okay, let's look at your function now, what line do you do your calculation of area on?
User: It's Pi times the radius squared.
Assistant: Let's think about those two different values for the radius. Do they act differently when they are squared?
	<alt>Okay, let's look at your function now, what line do you do your calculation of area on?
	<alt>What happens when you square 1?
	<alt>What is the Python operator for squaring a number?
User: Yes, 1 squared doesn't change it's still 1, and 2.5 squared is 6.25.
	<alt>I think made a mistake on the squaring part.
Assistant: Okay, since it works for 1 but not for 2.5, let's look at the code that does the squaring. Where is that code?
	<alt>Does 1 have any special properties when you multiply it that might make it act differently?
	<alt>What is the Python operator for squaring a number?
User: That's on line 5.
Assistant: What is the expression that is doing the squaring?
	<alt>What operator does the squaring?
User: It is the radius ** radius part.
Assistant: What does it mean to square a number?
	<alt>How do you raise a variable to a power?
	<alt>Look back at the Python documentation, how do you raise a variable to a specific value?
	<alt>What does ** mean?
User: It means you multiply it times itself.
Assistant: Okay, so what does ** mean?
	<alt>What does * mean?
	<alt>Look back at the Python documentation, how do you raise a variable to a specific value?
	<alt>Is there a difference between the operators for multiplying and raising to a power?
User: It means to raise to a power.
	<alt>Oh! I'm raising the radius to itself instead of squaring it!
Assistant: What should you be doing to the radius?
	<alt>What does * mean?
	<alt>Is there a difference between the operators for multiplying and raising to a power?
User: I'm supposed to multiply it by itself, not raise it to itself!
<code>
1. import math
2.def area_circle(radius):
3.    if radius < 0:
4.        return 0
5.    return math.pi * radius * radius

Assistant: Does it pass the test cases now?
User: Yes! It passes, thank you!
