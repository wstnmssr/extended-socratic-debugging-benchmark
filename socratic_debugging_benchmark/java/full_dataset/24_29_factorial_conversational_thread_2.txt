<problem>
Write a function `factorial(int n)` that computes the factorial n! of a natural number n, which is defined mathematically as:

$0! = 1$
$n! = n \times (n - 1)!$

Additionally, if the input integer n is negative the function should return 0.

## Example Cases:
```
factorial(-1) => 0
factorial(0) => 1
factorial(1) => 1
factorial(2) => 2
factorial(3) => 6
factorial(4) => 24
factorial(5) => 120
```

2.    public static int factorial(int n) {
3.        if (n < 0) {
4.            return 0;
5.        }
6.        int fact = 1;
7.        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
8.            fact = fact * i;
9.        }
10.       return fact;
11.   }

On line 8, `fact` is multiplied with 0 in the first iteration of the for loop. Consequently, at every iteration fact stays equal with 0 instead of being updated to be equal with factorial of `(i + 1)`. Therefore, the function will return 0, irrespective of n.
</bug_desc>
<bug_fixes>
Replace `i` with `(i + 1)` in line 8.
Replace `i = 0` with `i = 1` and `i < n` with `i <= n` in line 7.

User: Hi! I implemented the factorial function but it doesn't work and I do not know why. Can you help?
Assistant: Sure. Can you tell me for what values of `n` it fails and what values it returns in those cases?
	<alt>Certainly. Can you tell me what happens when you run the function with `n = 2`?
	<alt>Can you describe your issue in more detail?
	<alt>Try running the function against the test cases. Do you observe any patterns?
User: For n = 1 or larger it returns the same value, 0.
Assistant: Let's see what happens when `n` is 1. What is the first value that is assigned to variable `i` in line 7?
	<alt>Let's see what happens when `n` is 1. Before line 8 is evaluated in the first iteration of the for loop, what are the values of the variables `fact` and `i`?
	<alt>Let's see what happens when `n` is 1. Can you insert a new line between lines 7 and 8 that prints the values of the variables `fact` and `i`?
	<alt>Let's see what happens when `n` is 1. What does `i = 0` do when `n` is 1?
	<alt>Can you tell me what `i = 0` does?
	<alt>Let's start with a warm-up question, does `i = 0` start with 0 or 1?
	<alt>According to the Java documentation, does `i = 0` start with 0 or 1?
User: Oh! `i` is not declared before the for loop is created, maybe that causes this issue.
Assistant: Let's examine what happens in this case. Open the Java shell and type `for (int i = 0; i < 1; i++) { System.out.println(i); }`. What do you see?
	<alt>Let's investigate this further. Open the Java shell and type `for (int i = 0; i < 1; i++) { System.out.println(i); }`. Press `Enter` twice to execute. What do you see?
User: I see that `i` is not declared before the for loop is created. Yet the loop `for (int i = 0; i < 1; i++) { System.out.println(i); }` prints `0`. So the issue is not with initializing `i` before the for loop.
	<alt>I see a `0` printed in the loop `for (int i = 0; i < 1; i++) { System.out.println(i); }`. So the issue is not with initializing `i` before the for loop but rather with the first value of `i` in the for loop. It is not 1 but 0 so `fact` will always be 0.
Assistant: Good. Let's take a closer look. What is the first value of `i` in the for loop?
	<alt>Correct. What do you notice about the first value of `i` in the for loop?
	<alt>Notice that the value of `i` in the first iteration of the for loop is 0. How do you think this affects the value of `fact`?
User: I see. The value of `i` in the first iteration of the for loop is 0. So `fact` will always be 0 because the first value of `fact = 1 * 0` is 0. Then, `fact` will be `0 * 1` in the second iteration of the for loop, and so on.
Assistant: Good! How can we fix this issue?
	<alt>Good. Now, how can you modify the loop so that `fact` is not multiplied with 0 in the first iteration?
User: I think we can fix this by changing the initialization of `i` to `1` and the condition to `i <= n`.

Assistant: Good. Let's test it. What is the factorial of 5?
	<alt>Good. Does it pass all the test cases?
User: The factorial of 5 is 120. It works! It passes all the test cases.
Assistant: I am glad I could help. If you have any other questions, feel free to ask me.
User: Thank you!
