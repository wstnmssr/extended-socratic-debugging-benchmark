<problem>
Write a function `count_words(sentence: str) -> int` that returns the number of words in the sentence. A word is a maximal sequence of characters that does not contain spaces. For example, `count_words(" This is a sentence ")` returns 4. 
## Example Cases:
```
count_words("hello world") => 2
count_words("hello    world") => 2
count_words("This is a sentence") => 4
count_words("I love Python") => 3
count_words("") => 0
count_words(" ") => 0
```
</problem>
<bug_code>
1. def count_words(sentence):
2.    words = 0
3.    space_mode = True
4.    for i in range(1, len(sentence)):
5.        if sentence[i] == ' ':
6.            if not space_mode:
7.                words += 1
8.            space_mode = True
9.        else:
10.            space_mode = False
11.    if not space_mode:
12.        words +=1
13.    return words
</bug_code>
<bug_desc>
On line 4, the for loop skips over the first character in the string `sentence`. Consequently, the function can miss counting a word if the first character in `sentence` is a word.
</bug_desc>
<bug_fixes>
On line 4, replace `(1, len(sentence))` with `(len(sentence)):`
On line 4, replace `(1, len(sentence))` with `(0, len(sentence)):`
</bug_fixes>
<unit_tests>
assert count_words("hello world") == 2
assert count_words("hello    world") == 2
assert count_words("This is a sentence") == 4
assert count_words("I love Python") == 3
assert count_words("") == 0
assert count_words(" ") == 0

User: Hello! I am having a problem with this programming problem. My count seems off.
Assistant: Did you try running your code? If so, is there a pattern you notice between the output of your code and what the answer should be?
	<alt>Are there specific inputs that give you the wrong answer or is it always wrong?
	<alt>Off in what way?
User: Yes! My output seems to be 1 less than it should be.
	<alt>My output is sometimes correct and sometimes lower than it should be
Assistant: Does this happen with all inputs or just some inputs?
User: I only seem to notice it on sentences that begin with "I" or "A", so I guess one-letter words.
	<alt>It only happens with sentences that start with short words, it seems.
	<alt>I thought it was working properly, but I just checked the sentence "I walked the dog" and the output was wrong.
Assistant: Can you check how your function handles the beginning of the input? It seems like the issue might be there.
	<alt>It only happens with sentences that start with short words, it seems.
	<alt>Where do you count your first word?.
User: Oh, I see. I'm missing the first index when I loop. I guess I never put in the base case.
