<problem>
Write a function `substrLen(String s, String t) -> int` that takes as input a string `s` and a non-empty string `t` and returns the length of the longest substring of `s` that does not contain `t`. For example, if `s = "abracadabra"` and `t = "ca"`, then the longest substring of `s` that does not contain `t` is `"dabra"`, so the function should return 5.
## Example Cases:
```
substrLen("abracadabra", "ca") => 5
substrLen("I love Python", "Py") => 7
substrLen("contest", "test") => 3
substrLen("icey ice", "ice") => 2
substrLen("icey ice cream", "ice") => 6
substrLen("abracadabra", "abba") => 11
```
</problem>
<bug_code>
1. public static int substrLen(String s, String t) {
2.     int maxLen = 0;
3.     int start = 0;
4.     int pos = s.indexOf(t, start);
5.     while (pos != -1) {
6.         String crtStr = s.substring(start, pos);
7.         int crtLen = crtStr.length();
8.         if (crtLen > maxLen) {
9.             maxLen = crtLen;
10.        }
11.        start = pos + t.length();
12.        pos = s.indexOf(t, start);
13.    }
14.    return maxLen;
15. }
</bug_code>
<bug_desc>
The code does not check for the case when the longest substring is at the end of the string, therefore it fails on test examples 1 and 5.
</bug_desc>
<bug_fixes>
After line 12, insert the following outside the while loop scope:
```java
String lastStr = s.substring(start);
int lastLen = lastStr.length();
if (lastLen > maxLen) {
    maxLen = lastLen;
}
```
</bug_fixes>
<unit_tests>
assert substrLen("abracadabra", "ca") == 5;
assert substrLen("I love Python", "Py") == 7;
assert substrLen("contest", "test") == 3;
assert substrLen("icey ice", "ice") == 2;
assert substrLen("icey ice cream", "ice") == 6;
assert substrLen("abracadabra", "abba") == 11;

User: Hi! I need help with my code, it does not work on some test examples such as the first one, and I do not understand why. Can you help?
Assistant: I would be happy to. First, can you walk me through your code and explain what each variable is supposed to do?
	<alt>Sure. Using the input for the first test example, can you go through your code line by line and show the values calculated for each variable?
	<alt>Sure. Looking at the first test example, what is the longest substring your code finds and what is the correct substring?
	<alt>Sure. Can you list all the correct longest substrings for the test examples and see if you notice anything special about test examples 1 and 5 on which your code returns the wrong result?
	<alt>Sure. Inside the while block, right after line 6, can you include a print statement `print('crtStr = ', crtStr)`, run your code on the first test example, and see if you notice anything useful or missing about the strings extracted by your code?
	<alt>Sure. Do you notice anything different about test examples 1 and 5 on which your code does not work?
	<alt>Sure. Looking at the first test example, what is the correct longest substring and is there any variable in your code that stores that string at some point during its execution?
User: `maxLen` is a variable that stores the maximum length found so far, initialized with 0.  `start` stores the starting position in the input string `s` that we want to search for `t`, also initialized with 0. `pos` stores the position in the string `s` where the other string `t` is found. Inside the while loop, I have `crtStr` which stores the actual substring found between consecutive occurrences or `t` in `s`, with its length stored in `crtLen`. This substring is always between `start` and the current value of `pos`, which requires `start to be updated to contain the index right after the current occurrence of `t`.
Assistant: Very good. So, you are saying then that the maximum length substring should be one of the strings computed in `crtStr` that are found between consecutive occurrences of `t` in `s`. Looking at test example 1, what is the correct maximum length substring and does it appear between consecutive occurrences or 'ca' in the input string?
	<alt>Good. Do you think the maximum length substring always appears between consecutive occurrences of the string `t`?
	<alt>Very good. If the maximum length substring appeared at the end of the string `s`, would your code extract it in `crtStr`?
	<alt>Good. Can you tell me what is the last value that is assigned to `start` before `pos` becomes -1 and what is the substring of `s` that starts at that position?
User: Ah, I see now. The maximum substring should be "dabra", which is between the last occurrence of `t` and the end of the string. I should have checked for substrings that end at the end of `s`, let me do that ... It works now! Thank you!
