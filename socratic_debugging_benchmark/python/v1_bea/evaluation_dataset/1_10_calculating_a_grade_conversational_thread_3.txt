<problem>
Create a method `calculateGrade(hw:float, exams: float, projects: float, att:float) -> Tuple[str, int]` that takes in four float parameters between 0 and 100 representing a student's grades in four different categories: Homework (`hw`) which is worth 20% of the final grade, Exams (`exams`) worth 40% of the final grade, Projects (`projects`) worth 30%, and Attendance (`att`), worth 10%. The function should calculate the final grade a student is getting and return a tuple containing the final letter grade and the final numeric grade rounded up to the nearest whole number.

The letter grade should be determined based on the following scale:

* A for a final rounded grade between 90 and 100 (inclusive)
* B for a final rounded grade between 80 and 89 (inclusive)
* C for a final rounded grade between 70 and 79 (inclusive)
* D for a final rounded  grade between 60 and 69 (inclusive)
* F for a final rounded grade below 60.

For example, if you enter `calculateGrade(75, 60, 73, 87)`, the function should return `('C', 70)` because the final raw score is `69.6` which rounds up to `70` and corresponds to a letter grade of `C`.

## Example Cases:
```
calculateGrade(100, 100, 100, 100) => ('A', 100)
calculateGrade(100, 89, 85, 90) => ('A', 90)
calculateGrade(72, 96, 74, 98) => ('B', 85)
calculateGrade(100, 82, 68, 94) => ('B', 83)
calculateGrade(75, 60, 73, 100) => ('C', 71)
calculateGrade(75, 60, 73, 87) => ('C', 70)
calculateGrade(70, 60, 65, 70) => ('D', 64)
calculateGrade(12, 14, 23, 10) => ('F', 16)
calculateGrade(0, 0, 0, 0) => ('F', 0)
```

<bug_desc>
On lines 10, 12, 14, and 16 the function uses `finalScore`, which is not rounded to the nearest integer, to determine the `letterGrade`.  Consequently, the function returns the incorrect `letterGrade` on edge cases where the closest integer is in a new category.
</bug_desc>
<bug_fixes>
Replace `finalScore` with `roundedScore` on lines 10, 12, 14, and 16.

User: Hi! I implemented the `calculateGrade` function, but I am having some problems. Can you help me?
Assistant: I would love to! What kind of problems are you having?
User: I am returning ('D', 70) for test 4 and I don't know why.
Assistant: Let's walk through that test input then. Can you tell me what is the value assigned `finalScore` on line 7 for the inputs provided?
	<alt>Can you explain the differences between `finalScore` and `roundedScore`?
User: The value assigned to `finalScore` is 69.6.
	<alt>The value would be 70, right?
Assistant: What is the truth value of the boolean expression on line 14?
User:  It would be true, 70=70.
Assistant: Is that true? Can you verify that?
	<alt>What does the boolean expression on line 14 evaluate to?
	<alt>Can you explain the differences between `finalScore` and `roundedScore`?
	<alt>Is that true? Can you print the value of `finalScore >= 70`?
	<alt>Correct. Which block of the if-elif-else statement is executed?
User: Yes, I'll use a print statement to do that.

Assistant: And what does it print for test 4?
User: It prints `False` but I don't know why.
	<alt>Oh, it prints `False` because it's 69.6, not 70. I need to use `roundedScore` instead. That makes it work, thank you!

	<alt>How does the value of `finalScore` affect the truth value of the boolean expression on line 10?
User: Oh! I was using the wrong variable. After switching `finalScore` to `roundedScore` in the comparisons it worked. Thank you!
