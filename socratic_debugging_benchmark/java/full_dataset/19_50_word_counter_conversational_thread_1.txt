<problem>
Write a function `countWords(String sentence) -> int` that returns the number of words in the sentence. A word is a maximal sequence of characters that does not contain spaces. For example, `countWords(" This is a sentence ")` returns 4. 
## Example Cases:
```
countWords("hello world") => 2
countWords("hello    world") => 2
countWords("This is a sentence") => 4
countWords("I love Python") => 3
countWords("") => 0
countWords(" ") => 0
```
</problem>
<bug_code>
1. public static int countWords(String sentence) {
2.     int words = 0;
3.     boolean spaceMode = true;
4.     for (char c : sentence.toCharArray()) {
5.         if (c == ' ') {
6.             if (!spaceMode) {
7.                 words++;
8.             }
9.             spaceMode = true;
10.        } else {
11.            spaceMode = false;
12.        }
13.    }
14.    return words;
15. }
</bug_code>
<bug_desc>
There is an off-by-one error where the last word in `sentence` is not counted when `sentence` ends with a non-space token.
</bug_desc>
<bug_fixes>
Insert the following after line 12 outside the scope of the for loop:
```java
if (!spaceMode) {
    words++;
}
```
</bug_fixes>
<unit_tests>
assert countWords("hello world") == 2;
assert countWords("hello    world") == 2;
assert countWords("This is a sentence") == 4;
assert countWords("I love Python") == 3;
assert countWords("") == 0;
assert countWords(" ") == 0;

User: Hi! I'm writing some code to count words and it doesn't seem to be working
Assistant: What seems to be the issue?
    <alt>Let's walk through your code line by line. Can you explain what your code does?
    <alt>When you run your code, what do you observe?
User: My output counts are off by one
Assistant: Does this happen with all inputs?
	<alt>Hm, ok. Can you walk me through your code?
    <alt>Can you give me an example input where this happens? Include what you expect and what you get.
User: It's happened with all the inputs so far, but I'm not sure if it would happen with all of them
Assistant: Can you try perturbing the inputs? Maybe add characters before or after.
    <alt>What happens when you run `countWords("hello world ")`?
    <alt>How does your function handle trailing whitespace?
    <alt>Can you describe to me how you are counting words?
    <alt>Does your loop count the last word in the sentence?
User: It's still the same if I had numbers or non-letter characters after and before
Assistant: Have you tried adding whitespace?
    <alt>What happens when you run `countWords("hello world ")`?
User: Huh, weird. When I pass the input "hello world ", the answer is correct, but it is wrong without the whitespace at the end.
Assistant: How does your function handle trailing whitespace?
User: I see now, I'm not counting the last word unless a space follows it. I'll amend my code to handle this. It looks like it works!
<code>
public static int countWords(String sentence) {
    int words = 0;
    boolean spaceMode = true;
    for (char c : sentence.toCharArray()) {
        if (c == ' ') {
            if (!spaceMode) {
                words++;
            }
            spaceMode = true;
        } else {
            spaceMode = false;
        }
    }
    if (!spaceMode) {
        words++;
    }
    return words;
}

Assistant: Happy to help!
