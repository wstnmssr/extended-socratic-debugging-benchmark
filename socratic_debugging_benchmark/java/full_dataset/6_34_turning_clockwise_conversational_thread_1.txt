<problem>
The four compass points can be abbreviated by single-letter strings as “N”, “E”, “S”, and “W”. Write a function `turnClockwise (String compassPoint)` that takes one of these four compass points as its parameter, and returns the next compass point in the clockwise direction. If `compassPoint` has another value that's distinct from the four compass points listed earlier, return the value null.

## Example Cases:
```
turnClockwise("N") => "E"
turnClockwise("W") => "N"
turnClockwise("S") => "W"
turnClockwise("E") => "S"
turnClockwise(42) => null
turnClockwise("rubbish") => null
```
</problem>
<bug_code>
1. public class Compass {
2.    public static String turnClockwise(String compassPoint) {
3.        if (compassPoint = "N") {
4.            return "E";
5.        } else if (compassPoint = "E") {
6.            return "S";
7.        } else if (compassPoint = "S") {
8.            return "W";
9.        } else if (compassPoint = "W") {
10.            return "N";

User: Hello! I am having trouble with the code can you help me? It's throwing an error.
Assistant: What is the error that you observe?
	<alt>Let's start with a warm-up exercise. How do you assign the value "N" to a variable `compassPoint`?
	<alt>Can you describe what your code is trying to do?
User: I have a syntax error on line 3. I'm not sure why.
	<alt>The terminal says "SyntaxError: invalid syntax"
Assistant: Can you describe what you are trying to do on line 3?
	<alt>Ah. Can you show me how you would assign the value "N" to a variable `compassPoint`?
	<alt>What operator do you use to assign a value?
	<alt>What operator do you use to check for equality?
	<alt>Can you show me how you would check if the variable `x` is equal to 1?
User: I am trying to check if `compassPoint` is equal to "N"
Assistant: What operator do you use to check for equality?
	<alt>Ah. Can you show me how you would assign the value "N" to a variable `compassPoint`?
	<alt>What operator do you use to assign a value?
User: I use the `=` operator to check for equality.
	<alt>Oh! I should be using `==` instead of `=` to check equality
Assistant: Ah. Can you show me how you would assign the value "N" to a variable `compassPoint`?
	<alt>Can you show me how you would assign the value 1 to a variable `x`?
	<alt>What operator do you use to assign a value?
User: I would use `compassPoint = "N"`
	<alt>Oh! I should be using `==` instead of `=` to check equality
Assistant: Are you sure that you can use the same operator `=` for assignment and to check for equality?
User: Oh! I checked the documentation. I should be using `==` instead of `=` to check for equality. Let me edit my code.
	<alt>What operator should I use?
