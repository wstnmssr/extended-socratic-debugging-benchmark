<problem>
Write a function `count_words(sentence: str) -> int` that returns the number of words in the sentence. A word is a maximal sequence of characters that does not contain spaces. For example, `count_words(" This is a sentence ")` returns 4. 
## Example Cases:
```
count_words("hello world") => 2
count_words("hello    world") => 2
count_words("This is a sentence") => 4
count_words("I love Python") => 3
count_words("") => 0
count_words(" ") => 0
```
</problem>
<bug_code>
1. def count_words(sentence):
2.    words = 0
3.    space_mode = True
4.    for c in sentence:
5.        if c == ' ':
6.            if not space_mode:
7.                words += 1
8.            space_mode = True
9.        else:
10.            space_mode = False
11.    return words
</bug_code>
<bug_desc>
There is an off-by-one error where the last word in `sentence` is not counted when `sentence` ends with a non-space token.
</bug_desc>
<bug_fixes>
Insert the following after line 10 outside the scope of the for loop:
```py
if not space_mode:
     words +=1
```
</bug_fixes>
<unit_tests>
assert count_words("hello world") == 2
assert count_words("hello    world") == 2
assert count_words("This is a sentence") == 4
assert count_words("I love Python") == 3
assert count_words("") == 0
assert count_words(" ") == 0
</unit_tests>

User: Hi! I'm writing some code to count words and it doesn't seem to be working
Assistant: What seems to be the issue?
    <alt>Let's walk through your code line by line. Can you explain what your code does?
    <alt>When you run your code, what do you observe?
User: My output counts are off by one
Assistant: Does this happen with all inputs?
	<alt>Hm, ok. Can you walk me through your code?
    <alt>Can you give me an example input where this happens? Include what you expect and what you get.
User: It's happened with all the inputs so far, but I'm not sure if it would happen with all of them
Assistant: Can you try perturbing the inputs? Maybe add characters before or after.
    <alt>What happens when you run `count_words("hello world ")`?
    <alt>How does your function handle trailing whitespace?
    <alt>Can you describe to me how you are counting words?
    <alt>Does your loop count the last word in the sentence?
User: It's still the same if I had numbers or non-letter characters after and before
Assistant: Have you tried adding whitespace?
    <alt>What happens when you run `count_words("hello world ")`?
User: Huh, weird. When I pass the input "hello world ", the answer is correct, but it is wrong without the whitespace at the end.
Assistant: How does your function handle trailing whitespace?
User: I see now, I'm not counting the last word unless a space follows it. I'll amend my code to handle this. It looks like it works!
