<problem>
Create a method `returnOdd(List<Integer> nums) -> List<Integer>` that accepts a list `nums`. It should filter out all the even integers from the list `nums` and return a new list that contains only the odd integers from the original list.

## Example Cases:
```
returnOdd(Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10)) => Arrays.asList(1, 3, 5, 7, 9)
returnOdd(Arrays.asList(2, 4, 6, 8, 10)) => Arrays.asList()
returnOdd(Arrays.asList(1, 3, 5, 7, 9)) => Arrays.asList(1, 3, 5, 7, 9)
returnOdd(Arrays.asList(-76, -92, 9, -1, 7, 10)) => Arrays.asList(9, -1, 7)
```
</problem>
<bug_code>
1. public List<Integer> returnOdd(List<Integer> nums) {
2.    List<Integer> newNums = new ArrayList<>();
3.    for (int i : nums) {
4.        if (i % 2 != 0) {
5.            newNums.add(i);
6.    return newNums;
7. }
8. }
</bug_code>
<bug_desc>
There is a syntax error on line 6. The return statement is not within a function scope.
</bug_desc>
<bug_fixes>
Insert an indentation before `return newNums` on line 6.

assert returnOdd(Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10)).equals(Arrays.asList(1, 3, 5, 7, 9));
assert returnOdd(Arrays.asList(2, 4, 6, 8, 10)).equals(Arrays.asList());
assert returnOdd(Arrays.asList(1, 3, 5, 7, 9)).equals(Arrays.asList(1, 3, 5, 7, 9));
assert returnOdd(Arrays.asList(-76, -92, 9, -1, 7, 10)).equals(Arrays.asList(9, -1, 7));

User: Hi! I implemented my method but it throws a syntax error that says my return statement is outside the function. Can you help me resolve this?
	<alt>Hi! I am working on the method to remove even numbers, but it is not running because of line 6. Can you help me find out what is wrong here?
Assistant: Let's warm up by thinking about what the "scope" of a code block means. Do you know what that is and how that might affect a "return" statement?
	<alt>I'm here to help! Let's think about what this error might mean. Do you know what might be causing it?
	<alt>Sure, let's look at the error together. Do you know what the error "SyntaxError: 'return' outside function" means?
User: The scope refers to the visibility of a certain variable depending on where it has been used. For example, a variable defined inside a function is only visible to the function, and cannot be used outside the function.
	<alt>The scope means certain variables can only be used within the visibility of the code block they are a part of.
Assistant: That's right. Let's look back at your code now. Is the return statement in the correct scope?
	<alt>Right, so how would you indent line 6 so that it is part of the method?
User: I would need to indent it so that it is inside the function. I will make changes now.
<code>
1. public List<Integer> returnOdd(List<Integer> nums) {
2.    List<Integer> newNums = new ArrayList<>();
3.    for (int i : nums) {
4.        if (i % 2 != 0) {
5.            newNums.add(i);
6.    return newNums;
7. }
8. }
</code>
Assistant: Sounds great! Happy to help.
