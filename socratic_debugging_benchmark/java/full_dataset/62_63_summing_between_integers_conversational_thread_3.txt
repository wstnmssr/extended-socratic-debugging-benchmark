<problem>
Define a function called `SumBetween(int low, int high) -> int` which takes two integer inputs, low and high. This function should calculate the sum of all integers between low and high inclusive.

## Example Cases:
```
SumBetween(0,1) => 1
SumBetween(0,2) => 3
SumBetween(1,2) => 3
SumBetween(3,5) => 12
```
</problem>
<bug_code>
1. public static int SumBetween(int low, int high) {
2.     int num = 0;
3.     for (int i = low; i < high; i++) {
4.         num += i;
5.     }
6.     return num;
7. }
</bug_code>
<bug_desc>
The function returns the sum of numbers between `low` and `high`, but excludes the upper bound `high` instead of including both ends of the range.
</bug_desc>
<bug_fixes>
Replace `high` with `high + 1`.

assert SumBetween(0,2) == 3;
assert SumBetween(1,2) == 3;

User: Hello! I am having trouble with my `SumBetween()` function. It keeps producing values that are only a little bit wrong compared to the expected values, and I don't know why.
Assistant: Hello! I think that your issue may be in your understanding of `range()`. What do you believe is returned from `range(0,1)`, for example?
User: It would be a list containing 0 and 1, right?
Assistant: That is not correct. `range()` is not inclusive of its second argument, meaning that `range(0,1)` is actually a list containing only one element, 0.
User: Oh, I added 1 to `high` in my `range()` function and it works now, I didn't know that it wasn't inclusive of the second argument. Thank you for your help!

Assistant: I'm glad to be of assistance. Is there anything else I can do for you today?
User: No, that's all for now. Thank you!
