<problem>
Create a method `calculateGrade(hw:float, exams: float, projects: float, att:float) -> Tuple[str, int]` that takes in four float parameters between 0 and 100 representing a student's grades in four different categories: Homework (`hw`) which is worth 20% of the final grade, Exams (`exams`) worth 40% of the final grade, Projects (`projects`) worth 30%, and Attendance (`att`), worth 10%. The function should calculate the final grade a student is getting and return a tuple containing the final letter grade and the final numeric grade rounded up to the nearest whole number.

The letter grade should be determined based on the following scale:

* A for a final rounded grade between 90 and 100 (inclusive)
* B for a final rounded grade between 80 and 89 (inclusive)
* C for a final rounded grade between 70 and 79 (inclusive)
* D for a final rounded  grade between 60 and 69 (inclusive)
* F for a final rounded grade below 60.

For example, if you enter `calculateGrade(75, 60, 73, 87)`, the function should return `('C', 70)` because the final raw score is `69.6` which rounds up to `70` and corresponds to a letter grade of `C`.

## Example Cases:
```
calculateGrade(0, 0, 0, 0) => ('F', 0)
calculateGrade(70, 60, 65, 70) => ('D', 64)
calculateGrade(75, 60, 73, 100) => ('C', 71)
calculateGrade(75, 60, 73, 87) => ('C', 70)
calculateGrade(100, 89, 85, 90) == ('A', 90)
calculateGrade(100, 100, 100, 100) => ('A', 100)
```

<bug_code>
1. def calculateGrade(hw, exams, projects, att):
2.    finalScore = hw * 0.2 + exams * 0.4 + projects * 0.3 + att * 0.1
3.    if finalScore >= 90:
4.        letterGrade = "A"
5.    elif finalScore >= 80:
6.        letterGrade = "B"
7.    elif finalScore >= 70:
8.        letterGrade = "C"
9.    elif finalScore >= 60:
10.        letterGrade = "D"
11.    else:
12.        letterGrade = "F"
13.    return letterGrade, finalScore
</bug_code>
<bug_desc>
The function does not round `finalScore` to the nearest whole number. Consequently, when `finalScore` is `69.6` the function will return `D` instead of `C` as `letterGrade`. The function also returns a float `finalScore` instead of an integer.

<bug_fixes>
After line 2, add a new line with the following snippet `finalScore = round(finalScore)`.

User: My code doesn't work. When the `finalScore` is 69.6, the function returns D instead of C.
Assistant: Where, in your code, do you think this problem is happening?
	<alt>Why do you expect the output of 69.6 to return D?
	<alt>What do you think we can do to figure out where our problem is?
User: I think it's happening in the if-statements.
	<alt>I don't know where.
	<alt>It's happening in the if-statement `finalScore >= 70` and `finalScore >= 60` It isn't reaching the `finalScore` of 70.
	<alt>I think it's happening in the calculation of the `finalScore`. I'm not getting a rounded number.
Assistant: Try manually going through the if-statements yourself. If `finalScore` is 69.6, what output do you get? Which condition does it fulfill?
	<alt>Which condition in the if-statements is causing your problem?
User: Oh. I see. I need 69.6 to be rounded to 70, which would give me C, but it isn't being rounded. Obviously, it won't work this way.
	<alt>I am getting that 69.6 should be caught in the `elif finalScore >= 60`. 69.6 is greater than or equal to 60.
	<alt>I have no idea.
	<alt>I don't really understand how if-statements work.
Assistant: That's a good point! What do you think you should do next?
	<alt>Good observation! How would you round `finalScore`?
User: I need to round `finalScore`, but I don't know how to do that.
	<alt>I can use the `round()` method on the `finalScore`.
	<alt>I can do`finalScore = round(finalScore)`
	<alt>I can do `finalScore = finalScore.round()`
Assistant: You may need to look at the Python documentation to find the method you are looking for. Can you find a method that can help us?
	<alt>If you don't know how to round a variable, do you have any idea where you could look to figure it out?
User: Oh, wait. I found a round() function. If I don't specify the number of decimals, it rounds to the next integer. I could put a line of code that says `finalScore = round(finalScore)`.
	<alt>I have no idea what method can help me.
	<alt>I don't understand what a method is.
	<alt>I could use `finalScore = round(finalScore, 2)`
