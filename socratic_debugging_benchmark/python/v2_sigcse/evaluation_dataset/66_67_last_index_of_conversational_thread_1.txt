<problem>
Write a function called `LastIndexOf(value:int, array:list) -> int` which is passed two inputs: a value to search for, and a list of integers in which to search. This function should return the index position of the last occurrence (i.e. the rightmost occurrence) of the value being searched for. If the value being searched for does not exist in the array, then the function should return -1.

## Example Cases:
```
LastIndexOf(1, [1,1,1,1]) => 3
LastIndexOf(2, [2,0,1,2])  => 3
LastIndexOf(3, [1,1,1,1]) => -1
LastIndexOf(4, [4,1,1,1]) => 0
```
</problem>
<bug_code>
1. def LastIndexOf(value, array):
2.	index = 0
3.	for i in range(0, len(array)):
4.		if(value == array[i]):
5.			index = i
6.	return index
</bug_code>
<bug_desc>
The function returns 0 when `value` is not in `array` instead of returning -1.
</bug_desc>
<bug_fixes>
Initialize `index` to -1 on line 2.

<unit_tests>
assert LastIndexOf(1, [1,1,1,1]) == 3
assert LastIndexOf(2, [2,0,1,2]) == 3
assert LastIndexOf(3, [1,1,1,1]) == -1
assert LastIndexOf(4, [4,1,1,1]) == 0

User: Hello, I was having an issue with my `LastIndexOf()` function and I was wondering if I could get some guidance as to where I am going wrong.
Assistant: Hello! I am happy to help you. Can you explain what would happen in the case that the integer you are searching for is not in the list?
User: `index` would start at 0, then since the `if` condition is never met, it will stay as 0 and then `index` will return.
Assistant: And what would distinguish that action from the function finding a match at index 0?
	<alt>Can you explain the difference between that and if the first element is the last index of the value?
User: I suppose that is an important distinction to make. What number would be appropriate to return then? I'm not sure what number would not be misconstrued.
Assistant:  This is a good question, the answer is that value is arbitrary, and would be given. In this case, it is given in the problem.
User: Oh, it says -1 in the problem. Thank you for pointing it out!
