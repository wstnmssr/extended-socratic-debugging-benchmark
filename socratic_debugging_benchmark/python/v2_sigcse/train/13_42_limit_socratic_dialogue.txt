<problem>
Write a method `limitFinder(lst: List[int], limit: int) -> List[int]` that takes a list of numbers and a limit and returns a list of all the numbers in the list that are less than the limit.
## Example Cases:
```
limitFinder([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 3) => [1, 2]
limitFinder([1, 5, 4, 3, 5], 6) => [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
limitFinder([100, 2, 145, 3,8], 0) => []
limitFinder([-1, -3, -4, -2, -5], -3) => [-4, -5]
limitFinder([], 0) => []
```
</problem>
<bug_code>
1. def limitFinder(lst, limit):
2.  lst2 = []
3.  for i in lst2:
4.    if i < limit:
5.      lst2.append(i)
6.  return lst2
</bug_code>
<bug_desc>
On line 3, the for loop attempts iterating through `lst2` which is empty. Consequently, the for loop does not iterate and the function returns an empty list.
</bug_desc>
<bug_fixes>
Replace `lst2` with `lst` on line 3.

<unit_tests>
assert limitFinder([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 3) == [1, 2]
assert limitFinder([1, 5, 4, 3, 5], 6) == [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
assert limitFinder([100, 2, 145, 3,8], 0) == []
assert limitFinder([-1, -3, -4, -2, -5], -3) == [-4, -5]
assert limitFinder([], 0) == []

User: Hi! My program seems to always return an empty list instead of a list of numbers, can you help?
Assistant: Sure. Can you walk me through what each line does?
	<alt>Sure. Can you tell me which list are you supposed to find the numbers from?
	<alt>Sure, can you explain what line 3 does?
	<alt>Sure. It looks like your for-loop is never executed. Do you know why?
User: Line 2 - creates an empty list `lst2`, which will eventually store all the numbers that are less than the limit.
Assistant: Ok, what about the next line?
User: Line 3 - loops through all the numbers in `lst2`
	<alt>It looks like line 3 loops through the wrong list! Is that the issue here?
Assistant: How many numbers are in `lst2`?
	<alt>Will the for loop ever be executed?
	<alt>Is `lst2` empty?
	<alt>How many times will the for loop execute?
	<alt>Is that the list that you want to loop through?
User: `Oh I see, `lst2` is empty, so the for loop is never executed.
Assistant: Correct, how would you fix your for loop now?
User: Should I be looping over `lst` instead?
Assistant: Yes, what does the new code look like?
User: This code works, thank you!
