<problem>
Write a function `my_func(len: int) -> List[int]` that generates a list of `len` integers. The element at each position 'i' in the list should be computed as `i * 6 + rand.randint(1, len)`. Before calling the function, use 42 as the seed for the random number generator by calling `rand.seed(42)`. Assume that `len` is a non-negative integer.

## Example Cases:
```
my_func(10) => [2, 7, 17, 22, 28, 33, 38, 51, 50, 64]
my_func(7) => [4, 7, 13, 19, 26, 32, 41]
my_func(5) => [5, 7, 17, 20, 29]
my_func(3) => [2, 7, 14]
my_func(1) => [1]
```
</problem>
<bug_code>
1. import random as rand
2. rand.seed(42)
3.
4. def my_func(len):
5.    y = list(map(def yOf(x):  x * 6 + rand.randint(1, len),  range(len)))
6.    return y
</bug_code>
<bug_desc>
The function has a syntax error on line 4. Defining a function inside of the built-in function `map` using `def` is invalid.
</bug_desc>
<bug_fixes>
Replace `def yOf(x):` with `lambda x:` on line 4.
After line 2 insert the following:
```py
def yOf(x, len):
    return  x * 6 + rand.randint(1, len)
```
Replace `map(def yOf(x):  x * 6 + rand.randint(1, len),  range(len))` with `map(yOf, range(len), [len] * len)` on line 4.
After line 4 insert the following:
```py
def yOf(x):
    return  x * 6 + rand.randint(1, len)
```
Replace `map(def yOf(x):  x * 6 + rand.randint(1, len),  range(len))` with `map(yOf, range(len))`.

User: Hey, I learned recently about the use of `map` in Python and I'm trying to use it to solve this problem. I am stuck though. Can you help me out?
Assistant: Certainly. Can you describe what you know about the `map` function so far with an example if possible?
	<alt>Certainly. Can you describe what your code does on line 5?
	<alt>Certainly. Do you know what the `map` function takes in as parameters?
User: So I learned that the `map` function takes in a function and an iterable. The `map` function applies the function to each element in the iterable provided and returns an iterable. In this case, I am passing `def yOf(x):  x * 6 + rand.randint(1, len)` as the function and `range(len)` as the iterable. I really think I can solve this problem with `map`.
Assistant: Ah good explanation. When you try to run your code what do you observe in the terminal?
	<alt>Good explanation. So what is the specific issue that you have?
	<alt>Good explanation. Where can you learn more about the `map` function and its use?
User: So when I try to run my code, it throws a syntax error on line 5.
Assistant: Can you explain to me what the `def` reserved word in Python does?
	<alt>Can you describe what `def yOf(x):   x * 6  + rand.randint(1, len)` does?
	<alt>It looks like you are trying to define the function `yOf(x)` inside of the `map` function call. Do you think that's supported by Python syntax?
User: `def` stands for define and it creates a function in Python to be used later on in the code.
Assistant: It looks like you are trying to define the function `yOf(x)` inside of the `map` function call. Do you think that's supported by Python syntax?
User: I guess not from the looks of it. Maybe I should define my function outside of the `map` call?
	<alt>It seems to be the case. Not really sure though what to do though.
Assistant: Let's try defining the function `yOf(x)` before using it in `map`. Where do you think it is best to define your function?
User: Probably before `my_func` so on line 3. I can insert my function definition for `yOf(x)`.
	<alt>Maybe after line 4? Inside of `my_func` so that it is within scope?
	<alt>Not really sure.
Assistant: Sounds good. Let's try it. What do you pass into `map` now?
User: Hmm I edited my code to create my function `yOf(x)` on line 3. I think I'll pass in `yOf` to `map` since that is the function name. It seems like I get another error here saying `unsupported operand types` between an integer and a built-in function.
<code>
1. import random as rand
2. rand.seed(42)
3. def yOf(x):
4.    return x * 6 + rand.randint(1, len)
5. def my_func(len):
6.    y = list(map(yOf,  range(len)))
7.    return y

</code>
Assistant: What does `len` refer to on line 4?
User: Hmm. It refers to my variable `len` does it not?
	<alt>Ah. I declare `len` on line 5. Since `len` on line 4 is out of scope it probably thinks that it is the Python built it function `len` that measures the length of an iterable.
Assistant: Where do you declare `len` in your code?
User: I declare `len` on line 5. I see it now. Since `len` on line 4 is out of scope it probably thinks that it is the Python built it function `len` that measures the length of an iterable.
Assistant: According to the problem specification, what is the upper-bound of the randomly generated integers?
	<alt>Given the function call `my_func(5)`. What would you need to pass into `rand.randint` as the upper-bound on line 4?
User: Hm. I think it would be the value on `len` from `my_func`. Given the function call `my_func(5)` it would be `rand.randint(1, 5)`.
	<alt>Hm. I think it would be the value on `len` from `my_func`. Given the function call `my_func(5)` it would be `rand.randint(1, 5)`. Not really sure how I would pass `len` to the function `yOf` though.
Assistant: Good. So now how would you pass `len` as another parameter to your function `yOf` on line 6?
	<alt>Good. Where in your code would you need to pass `len` to `yOf`?
User: I actually don't know how to do that.
	<alt>I don't know how to do that. But I guess it would be inside the `map` function.
	<alt>I would probably pass it as another parameter of the `map` function and update `yOf` to take two parameters.
Assistant: Can you point me to a line where you think you might want to pass a new parameter to `yOf`?
	<alt>Do you know how many parameters `map` takes in?
	<alt>Where can you learn more about how to pass multiple parameters to a function called in `map`?
User: I think perhaps on line 6 where I try to apply `yOf` to all numbers from 0 to `len` using the `map` function. I would want to pass an element from `range` and `len` to each `yOf` function call.
Assistant: Good. Where can you learn more about how to pass multiple parameters to a function called in `map`?
User: Ah good point. Let me check the Python documentation now. I see so I can pass multiple parameters to `map` the first is the function I want to apply, and then I can pass as many iterables as I need as parameters. Let me edit my code and try it out.
<code>
1. import random as rand
2. rand.seed(42)
3. def yOf(x):
4.    return  x * 6 + rand.randint(1, len)  
5. def my_func(len):
6.    y = list(map(yOf, range(len), [len]))
7.    return y 

</code>
Assistant: Good. What do you observe after running this?
	<alt>How many parameters does the function `yOf` take on now?
	<alt>How many times are you calling `yOf` on line 7? How does that relate to the length of the iterables passed as parameters?
User: Ah. I get a runtime error. `yOf` expects two parameters. Let me fix that. I need to pass in `len` also as a parameter to it.
<code>
1. import random as rand
2. rand.seed(42)
3. def yOf(x, len):
4.    return  x * 6 + rand.randint(1, len)
5. def my_func(len):
6.    y = list(map(yOf, range(len), [len]))
7.    return y 

</code>
Assistant: What do you notice in your terminal now when you run this?
	<alt>How many times are you calling `yOf` on line 7? How does that relate to the length of the iterables passed as parameters?
User: I notice that it runs without any issues but it fails all the test cases. Hmm..
Assistant: How many times are you calling `yOf` on line 7? How does that relate to the length of the iterables passed as parameters?
	<alt>That's progress. Let's add a print statement to look at what `my_func (10)` is returning. What do you observe?
User: Hm. I think `yOf` is called as many times as there are iterables passed as parameters to the `map` function.
	<alt>Hm. I think `yOf` is called as many times as there are iterables passed as parameters to the `map` function. Oh I see. I am passing in only one `len` as my second parameter so maybe `yOf` is only called once because of that.
Assistant: Good. How many iterable elements are in your second iterables parameter to the `map` function?
User: Oh I get what's happening now!  I am passing in only one `len` as my second parameter so maybe `yOf` is only called once because of that.  I need to pass in an array of `len` values. That array needs to be as long as `range(len)`. I'm not entirely sure how to instantiate an array with a variable number of elements. Let me look into the Python documentation and fix that.
<code>
1. import random as rand
2. rand.seed(42)
3. def yOf(x, len):
4.    return  x * 6 + rand.randint(1, len)
5. def my_func(len):
6.    y = list(map(yOf, range(len), [len] * len))
7.    return y 

</code>
Assistant: Good work. Does your code pass all the tests?
User: Yes now it does! Thank you so much for all your help! I learned a lot today!
