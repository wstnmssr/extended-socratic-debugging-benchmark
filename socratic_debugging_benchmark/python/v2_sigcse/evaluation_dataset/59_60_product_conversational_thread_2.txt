<problem>
Define a function called `Product(a:int, b:int) -> int` which takes two integer inputs: a and b. The function should return the product of these two values (i.e. a * b).

## Example Cases: 
```
Product(1,2) => 2
Product(2,4) => 8
Product(4,4) => 16
Product(5,5) => 25
```
</problem>
<bug_code>
1. def Product(a, b):
2.	a * b
</bug_code>
<bug_desc>
The function does not return anything, thus when evaluated it computes the value `None` instead of returning the product.
</bug_desc>
<bug_fixes>
Add `return` before `a * b`.
</bug_fixes>
<unit_tests>
assert Product(1,2) == 2
assert Product(2,4) == 8
assert Product(4,4) == 16
assert Product(5,5) == 25
</unit_tests>

User: Hello, I'm having trouble with `Product()` function. I swear that I have done it correctly, but I'm failing even the first assertion and I can't figure out why.
Assistant: Okay, can you explain your `Product()` function in detail?
	<alt>How familiar are you with functions in Python?
User: I take in two inputs, which I have named `a` and `b`, and then I multiply the two numbers together.
Assistant: Okay, can you modify your code such that on line 3, you execute the line `print(Product(1,2))`?
	<alt>Are you familiar with a way to output the value of `Product(1,2)` to the user through the console?
User: Okay, I've made that change, but when I run it, it just prints out "None" and still failing the assertion. Shouldn't it be printing out a number?
<code>
1. def Product(a, b):
2.	a * b
</code>
Assistant: A function will only take on a value when the keyword `return` is used followed by a value. Otherwise, it will return a special value referred to by `None`, stating that the function did not return any value. Do you know where to put `return` in your code?
User: Oh! That makes a lot more sense. So I would place the `return` statement on line 2 like this?
<code>
1. def Product(a, b):
2.	return a * b
</code>
Assistant: Correct! When you run the code now, you should see that there are no longer any assertion errors.
User: Yes, that is the case. Thank you for your help!
Assistant: You're welcome, thank you for asking questions to further your understanding. It is important to understand the fundamentals when you are first learning. Is there anything else that I can help you with today?
User: No, that is all for now. Thank you!
