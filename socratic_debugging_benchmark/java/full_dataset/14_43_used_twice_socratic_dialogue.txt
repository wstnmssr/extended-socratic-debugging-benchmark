<problem>
Write a function `isTwice(String string, char ch) -> boolean` that returns `true` if the character `ch` appears exactly twice in the string `string`. Otherwise, it returns `false`.
## Example Cases:
```
isTwice("hello", 'l') => true
isTwice("hello", 'o') => false
isTwice("hello", 'h') => false
isTwice("", 'e') => false
isTwice("I'm a string!", ' ') => true
isTwice("Hey, I'm a string!", ' ') => false
```
</problem>
<bug_code>
1. public static boolean isTwice(String str, char chr) {
2.     int count = 0;
3.     for (int i = 0; i < str.length(); i++) {
4.         if (str.charAt(i) == chr) {
5.             count++;
6.         }
7.     }
8.     if (count >= 2) {
9.         return true;
10.    } else {
11.        return false;
12.    }
13. }
</bug_code>
<bug_desc>
On line 8, the function returns `true` if the character appears two or more times instead of exactly twice.
</bug_desc>
<bug_fixes>
Replace `count >= 2` with `count == 2` on line 8.

User: Hi! I wrote this code and it isn't working. can you help me?
Assistant: First, let's analyze how your program is behaving and why. Can you describe the issue that you are facing?
	<alt>It seems that you have a `NameError` error in your code. Are you able to find where this error is?
	<alt>Let's talk about boolean variables. Can you explain the difference between a boolean variable with the value of `False` versus a string variable with the value `"False"` is?
	<alt>Let's start with a warm-up question. What are the two possible values of a boolean variable in Python?
User: I have a syntax error. My code won't even compile.
	<alt>I think it's a runtime error because it just stopped running.
	<alt>Can you tell me what the different types of errors are? I don't remember.
	<alt>It's a logic error, I think. That's the one that is the result of a grammatical error, right?
Assistant: I see! Let's try to solve a simpler problem. Can you write a code snippet of assigning `True` to a boolean variable called 'var'?
	<alt>Can you write a code snippet of assigning `False` to a boolean variable called 'var'?
	<alt>Where is the syntax error located in your code? You look for the line number.
	<alt>How do you know that it is a syntax error? What are the different types of errors?
User: `var = True`
	<alt>`var = true`
	<alt>var = 1
	<alt>var = "True"
Assistant: That's right. Is this what you wrote in your code on line 8?
	<alt>That's right. Can you look back at where you use boolean variables and see if you used the correct syntax?
	<alt>Can you point out in your code where you use boolean variables?
User: No it isn't. I see. Well... the is not a boolean variable anymore. The value you assign to the code determines what kind of data type it is. Since I did not write 'True' in this exact format, I imagine that the program had interpreted the value as a variable that hasn't been initialized instead.
	<alt>The code would get a syntax error and it wouldn't run.
	<alt>I'm not sure what you are asking.
Assistant: That's right! How can you modify your `isTwice` function now to fix this error?
User: Oh! I found it! I was returning all lowercase True and False values! I will fix it.
<code>
public static boolean isTwice(String str, char chr) {
    int count = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < str.length(); i++) {
        if (str.charAt(i) == chr) {
            count++;
        }
    }
    if (count == 2) {
        return true;
    } else {
        return false;
    }
}
</code>
Assistant: Looks like it works now. Good job!
User: Thanks!
