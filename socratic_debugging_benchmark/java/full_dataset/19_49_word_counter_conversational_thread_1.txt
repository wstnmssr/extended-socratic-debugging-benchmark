<problem>
Write a function `countWords(String sentence) -> int` that returns the number of words in the sentence. A word is a maximal sequence of characters that does not contain spaces. For example, `countWords(" This is a sentence ")` returns 4. 
## Example Cases:
```
countWords("hello world") => 2
countWords("hello    world") => 2
countWords("This is a sentence") => 4
countWords("I love Python") => 3
countWords("") => 0
countWords(" ") => 0
```
</problem>
<bug_code>
1. public static int countWords(String sentence) {
2.     int words = 0;
3.     boolean spaceMode = true;
4.     for (int i = 1; i < sentence.length(); i++) {
5.         if (sentence.charAt(i) == ' ') {
6.             if (!spaceMode) {
7.                 words++;
8.             }
9.             spaceMode = true;
10.        } else {
11.            spaceMode = false;
12.        }
13.    }
14.    if (!spaceMode) {
15.        words++;
16.    }
17.    return words;
18. }
</bug_code>
<bug_desc>
On line 4, the for loop skips over the first character in the string `sentence`. Consequently, the function can miss counting a word if the first character in `sentence` is a word.

<bug_fixes>
On line 4, replace `(1, sentence.length())` with `(0, sentence.length())`.

<unit_tests>
assert countWords("hello world") == 2;
assert countWords("hello    world") == 2;
assert countWords("This is a sentence") == 4;
assert countWords("I love Python") == 3;
assert countWords("") == 0;
assert countWords(" ") == 0;

User: Hello! I am having a problem with this programming problem. My count seems off.
Assistant: Did you try running your code? If so, is there a pattern you notice between the output of your code and what the answer should be?
	<alt>Are there specific inputs that give you the wrong answer or is it always wrong?
	<alt>Off in what way?
User: Yes! My output seems to be 1 less than it should be.
	<alt>My output is sometimes correct and sometimes lower than it should be
Assistant: Does this happen with all inputs or just some inputs?
User: I only seem to notice it on sentences that begin with "I" or "A", so I guess one-letter words.
	<alt>It only happens with sentences that start with short words, it seems.
	<alt>I thought it was working properly, but I just checked the sentence "I walked the dog" and the output was wrong.
Assistant: Can you check how your function handles the beginning of the input? It seems like the issue might be there.
	<alt>It only happens with sentences that start with short words, it seems.
	<alt>Where do you count your first word?
User: Oh, I see. I'm missing the first index when I loop. I guess I never put in the base case.
<code>
public static int countWords(String sentence) {
    int words = 0;
    boolean spaceMode = true;
    for (int i = 0; i < sentence.length(); i++) {
        if (sentence.charAt(i) == ' ') {
            if (!spaceMode) {
                words++;
            }
            spaceMode = true;
        } else {
            spaceMode = false;
        }
    }
    if (!spaceMode) {
        words++;
    }
    return words;
