<problem>
You like to eat pizzas for dinner. A good dinner is a dinner where you eat between 10 and 20 pizzas (inclusive). Unless it is a weekend, in which case there is no upper bound on the number of pizzas. Write a function called `GoodDinner(pizzas_int, weekend:bool) -> bool` which takes two inputs: the number of pizzas you eat, and a boolean which is true if it is the weekend and false otherwise. Your function should return true if you had a good dinner, and false if you didn't.

## Example Cases:
```
GoodDinner(10, False) => True
GoodDinner(20, False) => True
GoodDinner(5, False) => False
GoodDinner(21, False) => False
GoodDinner(10, True) => True
GoodDinner(21, True) => True
GoodDinner(5, True) => False
```
</problem>
<bug_code>
1. def GoodDinner(pizzas, weekend):
2.        if(pizzas >= 10 and weekend):
3.                return True
4.        elif(pizzas <= 20 and not(weekend)):
5.                return True
6.        return False
</bug_code>
<bug_desc>
The function incorrectly returns True instead of False when it is a weekday and `pizzas` is less than 10. 
</bug_desc>
<bug_fixes>
Insert `pizzas >= 10 and` before `pizzas <= 20 and not(weekend)` in the elif condition on line 4.

User: Hello! I was working on my `GoodDinner()` function and I'm running into a roadblock. I just can't see where the issue in my code is.
Assistant: Okay let's start with the simpler case. When `weekend` is `True`, how many pizzas would make turn a dinner into a good dinner?
	<alt>What would happen when `pizzas` is between 0 and 9, but `weekend` is `False`?
User: It would be 10 or more pizzas.
Assistant: And how would you produce a boolean that is `True` when the `pizzas` fits that condition?
User: It would be `pizzas >= 10`.
Assistant: Okay, and making an `and` between these two makes your first condition. Now let's move to the more complex condition. When `weekend` is `False`, how many pizzas would make a dinner into a good dinner?
User: It would be between 10 and 20 pizzas, inclusively.
Assistant: Correct, and how would you express that in Python?
User: Would it be `10 <= pizzas <= 20`?
Assistant: That notation does not work in Python, you can instead split it up into two statements using an `and` operation. How would you put your previous statement into two statements?
	<alt>That notation is not correct Python syntax. How would you simplify this problem? It may help to physically speak what the mathematical symbols mean.
User: Oh, I put it as `10 <=pizzas and pizzas <= 20` and that fixed my code. Thank you!

Assistant: I'm glad to hear that I was able to help. Is there anything else I could help you with?
User: No, that's all for now. Thank you!
