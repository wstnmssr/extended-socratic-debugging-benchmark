<problem>
Write a function `search(int x, int[] seq)` that returns the index of the first occurrence of `x` in `seq`. If `x` is not in `seq`, return the index where `x` should be inserted to keep `seq` sorted. Assume that `seq` is sorted in ascending order.
## Example Cases:
```
search(5, new int[]{-1, 5, 8, 10, 12}) => 1
search(-2, new int[]{-1, 57, 65}) => 0
search(0, new int[]{-120, 60, 78, 100}) => 1
search(77, new int[]{-100, -50, 5, 44, 66, 76, 99}) => 6
search(55, new int[]{-99, -2, 0}) => 3
```
</problem>
<bug_code>
1. public static int search(int x, int[] seq) {
2.   for (int i = 0; i < seq.length; i++) {
3.     if (x <= seq[i]) {
4.       return i;
5.     }
6.   }
7. }
</bug_code>
<bug_desc>
The function returns `null` when `x` is greater than all of the elements in `seq` instead of returning the index indicating that `x` should be inserted at the end of the array.
</bug_desc>
<bug_fixes>
Insert a line following line 4, with one indentation containing `return seq.length;`

assert search(5, new int[]{-1, 5, 8, 10, 12}) == 1;
assert search(-2, new int[]{-1, 57, 65}) == 0;
assert search(0, new int[]{-120, 60, 78, 100}) == 1;
assert search(77, new int[]{-100, -50, 5, 44, 66, 76, 99}) == 6;
assert search(55, new int[]{-99, -2, 0}) == 3;

User: Hi! I seem to be having some issues with this function I am trying to implement. It sometimes returns `null` instead of an output. 
Assistant: What inputs have you tried? When do you get `null`?
	<alt>Do you notice a pattern with the cases that produce `null`?
	<alt>When do you notice `null` as the output?
	<alt>What inputs have you tried? When do you get `null`?
	<alt>It seems that your function may be returning nothing in certain cases. Can you think of a case where this might happen?
User: I tried a lot of examples. One that worked correctly was `search(-2, new int[]{-1, 57, 65})`, but I got `null` when I tried `search(80, new int[]{-1, 57, 65})`.
	<alt>I tried a few different ones. It looks like answers are only incorrect when `x` is really big relative to the numbers in the list
	<alt>It seems like I get the wrong answer when `x` is bigger than all the existing list elements
Assistant: Can you walk me through what `search(80, new int[]{-1, 57, 65})` looks like at each line of your code? What would you expect as the output?
	<alt>Compare and contrast the successful example `search(-2, new int[]{-1, 57, 65})` with the failing example `search(80, new int[]{-1, 57, 65})` where your function returns None. Does anything about `x` and `seq` in these examples stand out to you?
	<alt>What do you expect your code to return when `x` is bigger than the `seq` elements?
User: Sure! First, we iterate through the list elements. At each element, we check if `x` is less than or equal to it. In that case, we would want to insert at that index, so we return the index.
Assistant: What happens if `x` is not less than or equal to any element?
	<alt>What does your code do if `x` is greater than all of the elements in `seq`?
User: I guess it doesn't return anything. I should add a case for that. Now that I've modified it, it seems to work!
<code>
1. public static int search(int x, int[] seq) {    
2.   for (int i = 0; i < seq.length; i++) {
3.     if (x <= seq[i]) {
4.       return i;
5.     }
6.   }
7.   return seq.length;
8. }

Assistant: Good work. Let me know if you have any other questions.
User: Thanks!
