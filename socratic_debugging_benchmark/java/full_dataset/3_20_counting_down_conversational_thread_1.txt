<problem>
Create a method `sequenceBetween(int start, int end)` that takes two positive integers and returns a list of all the numbers between the integers, including the start and end values. You begin counting from `start`, and end counting on `end`. If `start` is smaller than `end`, then you perform a "countup" operation where you return a list of the numbers from the smaller number to the bigger number. If the user enters a bigger number as `start` you perform a "countdown" operation where you return a list of all the numbers from the bigger number to the smaller number.

## Example Cases:
```
sequenceBetween(0, 3) => Arrays.asList(0, 1, 2, 3)
sequenceBetween(1, 1) => Arrays.asList(1)
sequenceBetween(7, 5) => Arrays.asList(7, 6, 5)
sequenceBetween(100, 95) => Arrays.asList(100, 99, 98, 97, 96, 95)
sequenceBetween(12, 10) => Arrays.asList(12, 11, 10)
sequenceBetween(14, 20) => Arrays.asList(14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20)
```

17. }

<bug_desc>
On lines 5 and 11, there is an off by one error. The while loop ranges are inclusive of `start` but exclusive of `end`. Consequently, the function returns a list that includes all the numbers from `start` to `end - 1` instead of `end`.

<bug_fixes>
Replace `>` with `>=` on line 5 and `<` with `<=` on line 11.

User: Hi I need to fix my code, I am not getting the expected output.
Assistant: Sure, let's walk through your code. When you provide the first test input `sequenceBetween(0, 3)` what are the values in your output list `l`?
	<alt>Here to help! Let's go through your code, and the expected output together. Can you track each variable when you try `sequenceBetween(0, 3)`?
	<alt>Let's take a look at your code, can you test what happens when you run `sequenceBetween(0, 3)`? What do you notice?
	<alt>Let's go through code, and focus on what happens when you try the first test case - `sequenceBetween(0, 3)`. Which lines reflect the code that runs in this case?
	<alt>Can you tell me what happens when you enter `(0, 3)`as the input? Which lines execute and what is stored in the variables?
User: I think that in lines 10 to 13, the while condition completes execution before it reaches the end value.
	<alt>When the `start` is 0, and `end` is 3, the else condition on lines 10 to 13 executes. This means that the while loop executes when `i` is 0, 1, 2. Ah I see that when `i` is 3, the while loop does not execute and that means `l` does not contain 3.
Assistant: That's right. In your `else` condition, we run into this error. Let's also review your `if` condition. Do you observe any similar issues?
	<alt>Let's also try other test cases. Based on the observed outputs, do you think there is another similar issue in your code? If yes, which lines are affected?
	<alt>Let's complete our analysis of the issues by checking what happens if we run the other test cases as well. Do you observe any issues?
User: Yes, the while loop in the `if` condition also has a similar issue. I will fix this issue for both the if and else conditions.
<code>
1. public static List<Integer> sequenceBetween(int start, int end) {
2.    List<Integer> l = new ArrayList<>();
3.    if (start >= end) {
4.        int i = start;
5.        while (i >= end) {
6.            l.add(i);
7.            i--;
8.        }
9.    } else {
10.        int i = start;
11.        while (i <= end) {
12.            l.add(i);
13.            i++;
14.        }
15.    }
16.    return l;
17. }
</code>
Assistant: Do all the test cases work correctly now?
User: Yes they do, thanks!
