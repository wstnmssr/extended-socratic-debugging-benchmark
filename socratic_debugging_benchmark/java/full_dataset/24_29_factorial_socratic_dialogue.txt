<problem>
Write a function `factorial(int n)` that computes the factorial n! of a natural number n, which is defined mathematically as:

$0! = 1$
$n! = n \times (n - 1)!$

Additionally, if the input integer n is negative the function should return 0.

## Example Cases:
```
factorial(-1) => 0
factorial(0) => 1
factorial(1) => 1
factorial(2) => 2
factorial(3) => 6
factorial(4) => 24
factorial(5) => 120
```

5.        }
6.        int fact = 1;
7.        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
8.            fact = fact * i;
9.        }
10.       return fact;
11.   }

<bug_desc>
On line 8, `fact` is multiplied with 0 in the first iteration of the for loop. Consequently, at every iteration fact stays equal with 0 instead of being updated to be equal with factorial of `(i + 1)`. Therefore, the function will return 0, irrespective of n.
</bug_desc>
<bug_fixes>
Replace `i` with `(i + 1)` in line 8.
Replace `i = 0` with `i = 1` and `i < n` with `i <= n` in line 7.

User: Hi! I implemented the factorial function but it doesn't work and I do not know why. Can you help?
Assistant: Sure. Can you tell me for what values of `n` it fails and what values it returns in those cases?
	<alt>Certainly. Can you tell me what happens when you run the function with `n = 2`?
	<alt>Can you describe your issue in more detail?
	<alt>Try running the function against the test cases. Do you observe any patterns?
User: For `n = 1` or larger it returns the same value, 0.
Assistant: Let's see what happens when `n` is 1. What is the first value that is assigned to variable `i` in line 7?
	<alt>Let's see what happens when `n` is 1. Before line 8 is evaluated in the first iteration of the for loop, what are the values of the variables `fact` and `i`?
	<alt>Let's see what happens when `n` is 1. Can you insert a new line between lines 7 and 8 that prints the values of the variables `fact` and `i`?
	<alt>Let's see what happens when `n` is 1. What does `i = 0` do when `n` is 1?
	<alt>Can you tell me what `i = 0` does?
	<alt>Let's start with a warm-up question, does `i = 0` start with 0 or 1?
	<alt>According to the Java documentation, does `i = 0` start with 0 or 1?
User: The first value assigned to `i` will be 1.
	<alt>Aaah, I understand! The first value assigned to `i` will be 0, because `range` by default starts at 0.
Assistant: Are you sure about that? Can you verify that indeed the first value assigned to `i` is 1?
	<alt>Can you explain how `i` would be equal to 1 during the first iteration of the for loop?
	<alt>Let's assume that `i` is equal to 1 during the first iteration of the for loop. Given that `fact` is assigned the value 1 on line 6, how do you explain the function returning 0 when `n` is 1?
	<alt>How can you verify that the first value assigned to `i` is 1?
	<alt>Let's verify this. Open the Java shell and type `for (int i = 0; i < 1; i++) { System.out.println(i); }`. What do you see? 
	<alt>Let's verify this. Add a print statement inside the for loop that prints the value of `i` at each iteration. What is the first value of `i`?
User: I don't know, how can I verify that?
	<alt>OK, let me print its value at each iteration.
	<alt>OK, let me check in the Java documentation what range does.
Assistant: Can you edit the code to print the value of `i` at each iteration of the for loop?
	<alt>Can you look in the Java documentation to see what is the first value computed by range, when used with only one argument?
	<alt>Let's verify this. Open the Java shell and type `for (int i = 0; i < 1; i++) { System.out.println(i); }`. What do you see? 
	<alt>Let's consider this mathematically, `fact` is assigned the value of 1 on line 6. `fact` is multiplied by all values of `i` in a range. What value would `i` need to be for `fact` to be equal to 0 after the for loop?
	<alt>Let's try it out on the terminal. Open the Java terminal using the `java` command. Then, type in a for loop similar to yours with `n` being 2. Then, in your for loop body, add a print statement that prints `i`. What do you observe?
	<alt>Let's open the debugger. Step through your code until you reach line 8 for the first time. What do you notice about the value of `i`?
User: Sure. I see, the first value is 0, not 1!

Assistant: Good! Can you explain how that makes the function return 0 for n = 1 or larger?
	<alt>That's right. What happens when `fact` is multiplied by `i`?
User: I see, `fact` is multiplied by 0, so it becomes 0 and it stays 0 for all iterations of the for loop.
Assistant: How can you fix the code so that in the first iteration `fact` is multiplied with 1, not with 0?
	<alt>Think about what `for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)` does to `i`. How can you ensure that in the first iteration `fact` is never multiplied by 0?
	<alt>How can you change the for loop so that the iterator variable `i` is not equal to 0 in the first iteration of the for loop?
	<alt>Let's take it one step at a time. The cause of the issue is that `fact` is multiplied by 0 in the first iteration of the for loop. To fix this issue, what do we need to prevent?
	<alt>How can you change the for loop so that the iterator variable `i` iterates starting from 1?
User: I will multiply fact with `i + 1`. Let me do that … It works! Thank you for your help!

	<alt>I can change it to `for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++)` so that it starts iterating at 1.
	<alt>I can change it to `for (int i = 1; i < n; i++)` so that it starts iterating at 1.
	<alt>I can change it to `for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) { i = i + 1; }`, so that the first value is 0 + 1.
	<alt>I don't know, can you help?
Assistant: Did you also try it with `n = 2` and `n = 3`?
	<alt>Do you think your code will work for all values of `n`, for example `n = 3`?
User: Hmm … it returns the correct value for `n = 2`, but for `n = 3` it returns 3, which is wrong.
Assistant: The code you edited in line 9 was supposed to multiply `fact` with `i + 1`. Does that code really multiply `fact` with `i + 1`?
	<alt>Why is the code giving an incorrect answer for n = 3?
	<alt>What should the output of factorial(3) be?
	<alt>Consider the order of operations. What is being executed first addition or multiplication?
	<alt>What executes first `fact * i` or `i + 1`?
User: Aaaah, I see now, I should have used parentheses around `i + 1`. Let me do that… It works now! Thank you so much!

Assistant: You are welcome! Do not forget to remove the `print` statement and try it for other values of n as well.
