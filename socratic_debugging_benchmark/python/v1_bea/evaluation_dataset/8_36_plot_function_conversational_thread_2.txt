<problem>
Write a function `my_func(len: int) -> List[int]` that generates a list of `len` integers. The element at each position 'i' in the list should be computed as `i * 6 + rand.randint(1, len)`. Before calling the function, use 42 as the seed for the random number generator by calling `rand.seed(42)`. Assume that `len` is a non-negative integer.

## Example Cases:
```
my_func(10) => [2, 7, 17, 22, 28, 33, 38, 51, 50, 64]
my_func(7) => [4, 7, 13, 19, 26, 32, 41]
my_func(5) => [5, 7, 17, 20, 29]
my_func(3) => [2, 7, 14]
my_func(1) => [1]
```
</problem>
<bug_code>
1. import random as rand
2. rand.seed(42)
3.
4. def my_func(len):
5.    y = list(map(def yOf(x):  x * 6 + rand.randint(1, len),  range(len)))
6.    return y
</bug_code>
<bug_desc>
The function has a syntax error on line 4. Defining a function inside of the built-in function `map` using `def` is invalid.
</bug_desc>
<bug_fixes>
Replace `def yOf(x):` with `lambda x:` on line 4.
After line 2 insert the following:
```py
def yOf(x, len):
    return  x * 6 + rand.randint(1, len)
```
Replace `map(def yOf(x):  x * 6 + rand.randint(1, len),  range(len))` with `map(yOf, range(len), [len] * len)` on line 4.
After line 4 insert the following:
```py
def yOf(x):
    return  x * 6 + rand.randint(1, len)
```
Replace `map(def yOf(x):  x * 6 + rand.randint(1, len),  range(len))` with `map(yOf, range(len))`.

User: Hey, I learned recently about the use of `map` in Python and I'm trying to use it to solve this problem. I am stuck though. Can you help me out?
Assistant: Certainly. Can you describe what you know about the `map` function so far with an example if possible?
	<alt>Certainly. Can you describe what your code does on line 5?
	<alt>Certainly. Do you know what the `map` function takes in as parameters?
User: So I learned that the `map` function takes in a function and an iterable. The `map` function applies the function to each element in the iterable provided and returns an iterable. In this case, I am passing `def yOf(x):  x * 6 + rand.randint(1, len)` as the function and `range(len)` as the iterable. I really think I can solve this problem with `map`.
Assistant: Ah good explanation. When you try to run your code what do you observe in the terminal?
	<alt>Good explanation. So what is the specific issue that you have?
	<alt>Good explanation. Where can you learn more about the `map` function and its use?
User: So when I try to run my code, it throws a syntax error on line 5.
Assistant: Can you explain to me what the `def` reserved word in Python does?
	<alt>Can you describe what `def yOf(x):   x * 6  + rand.randint(1, len)` does?
	<alt>It looks like you are trying to define the function `yOf(x)` inside of the `map` function call. Do you think that's supported by Python syntax?
User: `def` stands for define and it creates a function in Python to be used later on in the code.
Assistant: It looks like you are trying to define the function `yOf(x)` inside of the `map` function call. Do you think that's supported by Python syntax?
User: It seems to be the case. Not really sure though what to do though.
Assistant: You wanted to learn more about the `map` function and how to use it in this problem. What is a good resource for you to find examples where the `map` function is being used?
	<alt>Let's try defining the function `yOf(x)` before using it in `map`. Where do you think it is best to define your function?
User: Ah. Let me look at the Python documentation for the `map` function. After looking through some examples -- I see `lambda` being used with `map` quite often for example you can declare a list `numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]` and then use the map function with `lambda` like this `result = map(lambda x: x + x, numbers)`.
Assistant: Good find. Let's try it in the terminal and printing `result` as a list. What do you observe is being stored in `result`?
User: I observe `[2, 4, 6, 8]` as the output.
Assistant: Given that, what do you think the `lambda` did in the snippet here?
	<alt>Can you describe what `lambda` does?
User: It seemed to have summed up each element in `numbers` with itself so `[1 +  1,  2 + 2, 3 + 3, 4 + 4]` so I guess `x` in `lambda` represent each element in `numbers`.
Assistant: Good. So looking at our programming exercises. Do you see a use for `lambda` in your code?
	<alt>Good. Now, where can you use `lambda` in your programming exercise?
	<alt>Good. Do you see a use of `lambda` in your `map` function call on line 5?
User: Ah yes! I'll replace my messy function declaration with `lambda`. I think it works!
<code>
1. import random as rand
2. rand.seed(42)
3. def my_func(len):
4.    y = list(map(lambda x:  x * 6 + rand.randint(1, len),  range(len)))
5.    return y

</code>
Assistant: Good work. Does your code pass all the tests?
User: Yes it does! Thank you! I learned more about `map` and `lambda` today!
Assistant: You're welcome!
