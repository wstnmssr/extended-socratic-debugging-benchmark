<problem>
Write a function called `CountOnes(int[] integers) -> int` which is passed one input, an array of integers. This function should count how many elements in the array are equal to 1, and it should return this number.

## Example Cases:
```
CountOnes(new int[]{1,1,1,0,0}) => 3
CountOnes(new int[]{1,0,0}) => 1
CountOnes(new int[]{}) => 0
CountOnes(new int[]{3}) => 0
```
</problem>
<bug_code>
1. public static int CountOnes(int[] integers) {
2.     int count = 0;
3.     for (int i = 1; i < integers.length; i++) {
4.         if (integers[i] == 1) {
5.             count++;
6.         }
7.     }
8.     return count;
9. }
</bug_code>
<bug_desc>
On line 3, the loop iterates `integers.length - 1` times instead of `integers.length` times. Consequently, the function does not access all elements in the `integers` array and always skips the first element in `integers`.
</bug_desc>
<bug_fixes>
Replace `1` with `0` in the `for` loop on line 3.

<unit_tests>
assert CountOnes(new int[]{1,1,1,0,0}) == 3;
assert CountOnes(new int[]{1,0,0}) == 1;
assert CountOnes(new int[]{}) == 0;
assert CountOnes(new int[]{3}) == 0;

User: Hello! I was working on my `CountOnes()` function and I keep getting the wrong count but I don't know what I'm doing wrong.
Assistant: Hello! Can you explain what your `for` loop does?
User: It is a loop over `for (int i = 1; i < integers.length; i++)` and then checks if the element of `integers` at index `i` is 1, and if it is, increments the count.
Assistant: Can you tell me how many elements are in `for (int i = 1; i < integers.length; i++)`?
	<alt>At what index do Java arrays begin?
User: Oh, it only has `integers.length - 1` elements. So I would have to use `for (int i = 0; i < integers.length; i++)`, right?
Assistant: That is correct, Java arrays index from 0, not 1.
User: That makes sense! The code is working as intended now, thank you!

Assistant: I'm glad that helped you understand. How else can I help you today?
User: No, that's all for now. Thank you!
