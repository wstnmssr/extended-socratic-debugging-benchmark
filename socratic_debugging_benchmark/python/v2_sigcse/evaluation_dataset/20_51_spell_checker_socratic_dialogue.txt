<problem>
Write a function `spellchecker(words: List[str], words_to_check: List[str]) -> Iterable[str]` that takes in a list of words and a list of words to check. The function should return an iterable of strings that indicate whether or not each word in `words_to_check` are spelled properly. A word is spelled properly if it is in the `words` list. If a word is spelled properly, the string should say "[word] is spelled properly!". If a word is misspelled, the string should say "[word] is misspelled!". The order of the strings in the returned list should be the same as the order of the words in `words_to_check`.
## Example Cases:
```
list(spellchecker(["dog", "cat", "giraffe", "horse", "dragon"], ["dogz", "cet", "giraffe", "horsee", "dragon"])) => ["dogz is misspelled!", "cet is misspelled!", "giraffe is spelled properly!", "horsee is misspelled!", "dragon is spelled properly!"]
list(spellchecker(["apple", "banana", "orange", "pear", "grape"], ["apple", "baana", "orange", "pier", "grayp"])) => ["apple is spelled properly!", "baana is misspelled!", "orange is spelled properly!", "pier is misspelled!", "grayp is misspelled!"]
list(spellchecker(['bubbles', 'cup', 'food'], ['bubbles', 'cup', 'food', 'bubbles', 'cup', 'food'])) => ['bubbles is spelled properly!', 'cup is spelled properly!', 'food is spelled properly!', 'bubbles is spelled properly!', 'cup is spelled properly!', 'food is spelled properly!']
list(spellchecker([], ['bubbles', 'cup', 'food'])) => ['bubbles is misspelled!', 'cup is misspelled!', 'food is misspelled!']
```
</problem>
<bug_code>
1. def spellchecker(words, words_to_check):
2.    result = []
3.    for word in words_to_check:
4.        if word in words:
5.            result.append(word + " is spelled properly!")
6.        else:
7.            result.append(word + " is misspelled!")
</bug_code>
<bug_desc>
The function returns `None` instead of an iterable of strings.
</bug_desc>
<bug_fixes>
After line 7, insert `return result` with one indentation level.

User: Help! I'm really stuck.
Assistant: Okay, where do you think the problem is?
	<alt>Are any of the test cases passing?
	<alt>Have you completed all the steps in the instructions?
	<alt>Let's look at your function, can you explain what it is supposed to do?
User: I don't know.
Assistant: Can you explain what your function is supposed to do?
	<alt>Do any of the test cases pass?
	<alt>Have you skipped any steps in the instructions?
User: My function takes in one list of words and compares it to another list.
	<alt>My function compares two lists of words and then returns information about them.
	<alt>I followed the prompt.
Assistant: Okay, on what line of code does it take in those lists of words?
	<alt>Does it do anything else?
	<alt>Is that everything it is supposed to do according to the prompt?
	<alt>Let's look at the first line of the function on line 1, does it take in two lists of words?
User: On line 1.
Assistant: Does that line take in those lists?
	<alt>Do you see any problems on that line?
	<alt>What should your function do after taking in those lines?
User: Yes, it does.
Assistant: Okay, so what is the next thing your function is supposed to do?
	<alt>Let's check the loops where we compare the lists, what line do those start on?
	<alt>How does your function compare the lists?
User: It's supposed to compare the two lists and say if the word is spelled wrong.
Assistant: Where is it supposed to put the information about the spelling?
	<alt>How does it determine if the word is spelled wrong?
	<alt>Let's examine the loop, what line does it start on?
User: In a list called result.
Assistant: Let's examine that list, where is it created?
	<alt>Let's examine that list, what happens to it after it is made?
	<alt>Let's examine that list, what lines is it modified on?
User: On line 2.
Assistant: What happens to that list next?
	<alt>Let's examine that list, what happens to it after it is made?
	<alt>Let's examine that list, what lines is it modified on?
	<alt>Do we do anything with that list after we finish adding to it?
User: We add strings to it for if the word is spelled right.
Assistant: Do we do anything else to it after we've finished with the loop?
	<alt>How would that information be sent out of the function?
	<alt>What information is supposed to be returned from the function?
User: No, we don't.
	<alt>I forgot to return result!
Assistant: How can that information be used outside of this function?
	<alt>What information is supposed to be returned from the function?
User: I need to return result.
<code>
1. def spellchecker(words, words_to_check):
2.    result = []
3.    for word in words_to_check:
4.        if word in words:
5.            result.append(word + " is spelled properly!")
6.        else:
7.            result.append(word + " is misspelled!")
8.        return result
</code>
Assistant: Does it work now?
User: No, it doesn't. 
Assistant: Is it passing any of the test cases?
	<alt>Look at what you added, why did you put it there?
	<alt>Look at what you added, when should this happen?
User: No, but the message changed to Assertion error.
Assistant: Okay, let's look back at what you added. When should that code run?
	<alt>Let's look at what you added. Should it be inside or outside the for-loop?
User: Oh! I put it inside the loop!
<code>
1. def spellchecker(words, words_to_check):
2.    result = []
3.    for word in words_to_check:
4.        if word in words:
5.            result.append(word + " is spelled properly!")
6.        else:
7.            result.append(word + " is misspelled!")
8.    return result
</code>
Assistant: Does it run correctly now?
User: Yes! Thank you!
