<problem>
Define a method called `product(int a, int b) -> int` which takes two integer inputs: a and b. The method should return the product of these two values (i.e. a * b).

## Example Cases: 
```
product(1, 2) => 2
product(2, 4) => 8
product(4, 4) => 16
product(5, 5) => 25
```
</problem>
<bug_code>
1. public int product(int a, int b) {
2.    a * b;
3. }
</bug_code>
<bug_desc>
The method does not compile because it is missing a return statement.
</bug_desc>
<bug_fixes>
Add `return` before `a * b;`.
</bug_fixes>
<unit_tests>
assert product(1, 2) == 2;
assert product(2, 4) == 8;
assert product(4, 4) == 16;
assert product(5, 5) == 25;
</unit_tests>

User: Hello, I'm having trouble with `product()` method. I swear that I have done it correctly, but I'm failing even the first assertion and I can't figure out why.
Assistant: Okay, can you explain your `product()` method in detail?
	<alt>Could you tell me what methods are and how are they used in Java?
	<alt>Upon running your code against the test cases, do you observe any errors?
	<alt>Can you describe what happens after the method finishes multiplying `a` and `b`?
	<alt>Suppose we run `int result = product(1, 2)`, what do you think the value of `result` will be after execution?
	<alt>Let's run `int result = product(1, 2)` and then print `result` and observe the output in the terminal. What do you see?
User: I take in two inputs, which I have named `a` and `b`, and then I multiply the two numbers together.
Assistant: Okay, can you modify your code such that on line 3, you execute the line `System.out.println(product(1, 2));`?
	<alt>How can we output the value of `product(1, 2)` to the user through the console?

User: Oh! I made the change and now it prints out nothing. I realized I just forgot to put a `return` statement and I've now fixed it. Thanks for the help!
<code>
1. public int product(int a, int b) {
2.    a * b;
3. }
4. System.out.println(product(1, 2));
</code>
Assistant: You're welcome! Any other ways I can help you today?
	<alt>How did you verify that your implementation is correct?
User: No, that's all for now. Thanks! I think my implementation is correct because it passes all the test cases.
