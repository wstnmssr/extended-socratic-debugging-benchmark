<problem>
Write a function called `LastIndexOf(int value, int[] array) -> int` which is passed two inputs: a value to search for, and an array of integers in which to search. This function should return the index position of the last occurrence (i.e. the rightmost occurrence) of the value being searched for. If the value being searched for does not exist in the array, then the function should return -1.

## Example Cases:
```
LastIndexOf(1, new int[]{1,1,1,1}) => 3
LastIndexOf(2, new int[]{2,0,1,2})  => 3
LastIndexOf(3, new int[]{1,1,1,1}) => -1
LastIndexOf(4, new int[]{4,1,1,1}) => 0
```
</problem>
<bug_code>
1. public static int LastIndexOf(int value, int[] array) {
2.     int index = -1;
3.     for (int i = 1; i < array.length; i++) {
4.         if (value == array[i]) {
5.             index = i;
6.         }
7.     }
8.     return index;
9. }
</bug_code>
<bug_desc>
On line 3, the loop iterates `array.length - 1` times instead of `array.length` times. Consequently, the function does not access all elements in the `array` list and always skips the first element in the `array`.
</bug_fixes>
Replace `1` with `0` in the `for` loop on line 3.

assert LastIndexOf(1, new int[]{1,1,1,1}) == 3;
assert LastIndexOf(2, new int[]{2,0,1,2}) == 3;
assert LastIndexOf(3, new int[]{1,1,1,1}) == -1;
assert LastIndexOf(4, new int[]{4,1,1,1}) == 0;

User: Help! I'm stuck!
Assistant: Okay, where do you think the problem is?
	<alt>Does the first test case pass?
	<alt>Which line has the first failing test case?
	<alt>Have you read the instructions carefully to check if your code does everything it needs to?
User: I don't know.
Assistant: Which line has the first failing test case?
	<alt>Does the first test case pass?
	<alt>Which line has the first part of your function on it?
	<alt>What is your function supposed to do?
User: It's failing test 4, on line 11
Assistant: Why is that one failing?
	<alt>Is the value in the array?
	<alt>Which line has the first part of your function in it?
	<alt>How is that one different from the first test case on line 8?
User: I don't know, it can't find the four.
Assistant: Since it can't find the four, can it find other values?
	<alt>Is there a four in the array?
	<alt>Is that different from test case 1?
	<alt>Which line has the first part of your function in it?
User: It found the one in the first test case.
Assistant: Okay, so it didn't find the four, but it can find other values. Does that give you any ideas about where the problem might be?
	<alt>What makes test case 1 and test case 4 different?
	<alt>Which line has the first part of your function in it?
	<alt>What part of the code checks each element in the array?
User: Maybe the problem is in the loop part where I check the values.
Assistant: What line is that on?
User: It's on line 3.
Assistant: Very good, so where should it start looking and stop looking?
	<alt>What exactly does this line do?
	<alt>What does "for" mean in Java?
User: It should start at the first element and stop at the end of the array.
Assistant: Which part of that line indicates that?
	<alt>What does "for" mean in Java?
	<alt>What is the numeric value of the first index in an array in Java?
User: The part inside the for loop.
	<alt>Oh! I'm starting at 1 instead of 0
Assistant: Which index does it start at?
	<alt>What is the numeric value of the first index in an array in Java?
	<alt>How do you find the first index of an array in Java?
User: It starts at 1.
	<alt>I'm starting in the wrong place!
Assistant: What number marks the first index of an array in Java?
	<alt>Could it be skipping anything?
User: Arrays in Java start at 0, I'm skipping the first index!
Assistant: How would you fix it?
	<alt>What number should be there?
<code>
1. public static int LastIndexOf(int value, int[] array) {
2.     int index = -1;
3.     for (int i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
4.         if (value == array[i]) {
5.             index = i;
6.         }
7.     }
8.     return index;
9. }
</code>
User: I switched it to a zero and it works! Thanks!
