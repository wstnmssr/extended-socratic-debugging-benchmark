<problem>
Write a function `count_words(sentence: str) -> int` that returns the number of words in the sentence. A word is a maximal sequence of characters that does not contain spaces. For example, `count_words(" This is a sentence ")` returns 4. 
## Example Cases:
```
count_words("hello world") => 2
count_words("hello    world") => 2
count_words("This is a sentence") => 4
count_words("I love Python") => 3
count_words("") => 0
count_words(" ") => 0
```
</problem>
<bug_code>
1. def count_words(sentence):
2.    words = 0
3.    space_mode = True
4.    for c in sentence:
5.        if c == ' ':
6.            if not space_mode:
7.                words += 1
8.            space_mode = True
9.        else:
10.            space_mode = False
11.    return words
</bug_code>
<bug_desc>
There is an off-by-one error where the last word in `sentence` is not counted when `sentence` ends with a non-space token.
</bug_desc>
<bug_fixes>
Insert the following after line 10 outside the scope of the for loop:
```py
if not space_mode:
     words +=1
```
</bug_fixes>
<unit_tests>
assert count_words("hello world") == 2
assert count_words("hello    world") == 2
assert count_words("This is a sentence") == 4
assert count_words("I love Python") == 3
assert count_words("") == 0
assert count_words(" ") == 0
</unit_tests>

User: Hi! I'm writing some code to count words and it doesn't seem to be working
Assistant: What seems to be the issue?
    <alt>Let's walk through your code line by line. Can you explain what your code does?
    <alt>When you run your code, what do you observe?
User: My output counts are off by one.
Assistant: Hm, ok. Can you walk me through your code? 
	<alt>Does this happen with all inputs?
    <alt>Can you give me an example input where this happens? Include what you expect and what you get.
User: Sure! Essentially, I walk through each character in the sentence. I only want to count a word when the characters change from spaces to letters, so I keep a `space_mode` boolean to keep track of when we are in between words.
Assistant: Ok. What happens when you reach the end of the sentence?
    <alt>Does your loop count the last word in the sentence?
User: Oh. I think I see the issue. I'm not counting the last word in the sentence. The for loop always ends on the last letter in the sentence which typically is not a space, so I never count the last word. `space_mode` is typically false at the end of the sentence, so I never increment `words`. I'll update my code to account for this.
<code>
 def count_words(sentence):
    words = 0
    space_mode = True
    for c in sentence:
        if c == ' ':
            if not space_mode:
                words += 1
            space_mode = True
        else:
            space_mode = False
    if not space_mode:
        words +=1
    return words
</code>
Assistant: Great! Let me know if you have any other questions.
User: Thank you so much for your help!
