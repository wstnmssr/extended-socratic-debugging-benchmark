<problem>
Write a method `split_apples(apples:int, children:int) ->int` that takes in an amount of apples and a number of children. The function should distribute `apples` evenly across all `children`. The function should return the whole number of apples each child will get after distributing the apples evenly. Assume that both `apples` and `children` are positive whole numbers.

## Example Cases:
```
split_apples(10, 2) => 5
split_apples(7, 2) => 3
split_apples(100, 100) => 1
split_apples(1, 2) => 0
```
</problem>
<bug_code>
1. def split_apples(apples, children):
2.    i = 0
3.    while apples > 0 and apples > children:
4.        apples = apples - children
5.        i += 1
6.    return i
</bug_code>
<bug_desc>
The while loop exits early when `apples` are divisible by `children`. Consequently, the function has an off-by-one error when `apples` is divisible by `children`.
</bug_desc>
<bug_fixes>
Replace `apples > children` with `apples >= children` on line 3.

<unit_tests>
assert split_apples(10, 2) == 5
assert split_apples(7, 2) == 3
assert split_apples(100, 100) == 1
assert split_apples(1, 2) == 0

User: Hi! My function fails two test cases and I do not understand why, can you help?
Assistant: Sure, I can help. Let's consider the third test case where `apples = 100` and `children = 100`. Can you manually run through the code and explain what happens, line by line?
	<alt>Sure. Do you see anything special about the test cases it fails, compared to the ones where it works well?
	<alt>Sure. Let's consider the third test case where `apples = 100` and `children = 100`. What is the number returned by your function?
	<alt>Sure. Can you explain to me what you are trying to do with the while loop?
	<alt>Sure. Can you tell me what the loop condition `apples > children` is there for?
	<alt>Sure. Can you explain your code to me, what is supposed to do, line by line?
User: On line 2, the variable `i`, which holds the number of apples we give each child so far, is initialized with 0. On line 3, we check to see first if `apples > 0`, which is true, and if `apples > children`, which is  ... false. Ah, I see where the problem is, the loop stops too early, it should iterate also when `apples` is equal to `children`. Let me fix that ... it works now, thank you!
