<problem>
Write a function called `CountOnes(integers:list) -> int` which is passed one input a list of integers. This function should count how many elements in the array are equal to 1, and it should return this number.

## Example Cases:
```
CountOnes([1,1,1,0,0]) => 3
CountOnes([1,0,0]) => 1
CountOnes([]) => 0
CountOnes([3]) => 0
```
</problem>
<bug_code>
1. def CountOnes(integers):
2.	count = 0
3.	for i in range(1, len(integers)):
4.		if(integers[i] == 1):
5.			count++
6.	return count
</bug_code>
<bug_desc>
On line 3, the loop iterates `integers - 1` times instead of `integers` times. Consequently, the function does not access all elements in the `integers` list and always skips the first element in `integers`.
</bug_desc>
<bug_fixes>
Replace `1` with `0` in the `range` call on line 3.
</bug_fixes>
<unit_tests>
assert CountOnes([1,1,1,0,0]) == 3
assert CountOnes([1,0,0]) == 1
assert CountOnes([]) == 0
assert CountOnes([3]) == 0
</unit_tests>

User: Hello! I was working on my `CountOnes()` function and I keep getting the wrong count but I don't know what I'm doing wrong.
Assistant: Hello! Can you explain what your `for` loop does?
User: It is a loop over `range(1, len(integers))` and then checks if the element of `integers` at index `i` is 1, and if it is, increments the count.
Assistant: Can you tell me how many elements are in `range(1, len(integers))`?
User: Oh, it only has `len(integers)-1` elements. So I would have to use `range(1, len(integers)+1)`, right?
Assistant: That's not quite right. Lists in Python begin at index 0, not index 1. Try to think about indices as "distance from the first element" rather than "element number".
	<alt>At what index do Python lists begin?
	<alt>Can you tell me how many elements are in `range(1, len(integers))`?
User: Oh, that makes a lot more sense. I made the change and my code is working as intended now. Thank you!

Assistant: I'm glad I could be of assistance. Is there anything else you wanted to discuss today?
User: No, that's all for now. Thank you!
