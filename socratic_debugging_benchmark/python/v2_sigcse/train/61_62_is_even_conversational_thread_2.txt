<problem>
Define a function called `SumIsEven(a:int, b:int) -> bool` which takes two integer inputs and returns true if and only if the sum of the two values is an even number. If the sum of the input values is an odd number, then the function must return false.

## Example Cases: 
```
SumIsEven(1,1) => True
SumIsEven(1,2) => False
SumIsEven(2,2) => True
SumIsEven(2,3) => False
```
</problem>
<bug_code>
1. def SumIsEven(a, b):
2.	return (a+b) % 2 == 1
3.
</bug_code>
<bug_desc>
The function returns True when `a + b` is not divisible by 2 instead of returning True when `a + b` is divisible by 2.
</bug_desc>
<bug_fixes>
Replace `1` with `0` to ensure that the sum is even.

<unit_tests>
assert SumIsEven(1,1) == True
assert SumIsEven(1,2) == False
assert SumIsEven(2,2) == True
assert SumIsEven(2,3) == False

User: Hello! I am having trouble making `SumIsEven()` work, and I think I have just managed to make it too complicated to easily debug. Can you help me convert it into an if/else control flow?
Assistant: Hello! I would be more than glad to help you with that. I notice your first line is already returning a boolean value, what if we use that as a condition for our `if` statement? First, let's simplify the problem so it's easier to look at. Can you store `a+b` in a temporary variable?
User: Okay! I've put the sum of a and b into the temporary variable `inputSum` and gone ahead and converted the return into an if/else but it's still not working as intended. Can you give me more guidance?
<code>
1. def SumIsEven(a, b):
2.    inputSum = a+b
3.    if(inputSum % 2 == 1):
4.        return True
5.    else:
6.	  return False
</code>
Assistant: Okay, when `inputSum % 2` is equal to 1, what does that mean about the value of `inputSum`?
	<alt>If `inputSum` is even, what is the output of `inputSum % 2`?
User: That means that `inputSum` is divisible by 2, right?
Assistant: That is incorrect. Modulo returns the value of the remainder when the first operand is divided by the second. Given this, when `inputSum % 2 == 1`, is `inputSum` even or odd?
User: Oh! That means the number is odd, right?
Assistant: Correct! Since the number is odd, what would the expected response from the `SumIsEven()` function be?
User: Oh, the expected output would be `False`, I had my booleans backward. Thank you for your help!

1. def SumIsEven(a, b):
2.    inputSum = a+b

5.    else:
6.	  return True

Assistant: I'm happy to help. Is there anything else I can do for you today?
User: No, that's all for now. Thank you!
