<problem>
Create a method `returnOdd(List<Integer> nums) -> List<Integer>` that accepts a list `nums`. It should filter out all the even integers from the list `nums` and return a new list that contains only the odd integers from the original list.

## Example Cases:
```
returnOdd(Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)) => Arrays.asList(1, 3, 5, 7, 9)
returnOdd(Arrays.asList(2, 4, 6, 8, 10)) => Arrays.asList()
returnOdd(Arrays.asList(1, 3, 5, 7, 9)) => Arrays.asList(1, 3, 5, 7, 9)
returnOdd(Arrays.asList(-10, -8, -6, -4, -2, 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10)) => Arrays.asList()
```
</problem>
<bug_code>
1. public List<Integer> returnOdd(List<Integer> nums) {
2.  List<Integer> newNums = new ArrayList<>();
3.  for (int i : nums) {
4.    if (i % 2 != 0) {
5.      newNums.add(i);
6.    }
7.  return newNums;
8. }
</bug_code>
<bug_desc>
There is a syntax error on line 3. The for loop syntax is incorrect.
</bug_desc>
<bug_fixes>
Add `{` after `nums` on line 3.

assert returnOdd(Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)).equals(Arrays.asList(1, 3, 5, 7, 9));
assert returnOdd(Arrays.asList(2, 4, 6, 8, 10)).equals(Arrays.asList());
assert returnOdd(Arrays.asList(1, 3, 5, 7, 9)).equals(Arrays.asList(1, 3, 5, 7, 9));
assert returnOdd(Arrays.asList(-10, -8, -6, -4, -2, 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10)).equals(Arrays.asList());

User: Hi, I am not sure why my program for removing even numbers is not running. Can you please help?
	<alt>Hi, my program for removing even numbers is throwing an error. Can you help me understand the error?
Assistant: Hi, Sure! It looks like your program has a syntax error on line 3, do you know what that means?
	<alt>Hi, Sure! Do you know why it is throwing a syntax error on line 3?
User: Does it mean that my expression on line 3 is not following the rules on how the for loop should be written?
Assistant: Yes, can you use the caret in your output to figure out what is wrong with your syntax?
User: It looks like there is something wrong towards the end of line 3, but I am not sure what that is.
Assistant: Can use the documentation to figure out the syntax of a for loop?
	<alt>It looks like you are missing a punctuation mark, do you know what that is?
User: Am I missing a curly brace at the end?
Assistant: Yes, you need to include that curly brace at the end of line 3.
User: This code now works, thank you for your help!
