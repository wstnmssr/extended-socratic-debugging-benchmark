<problem>
Create a method `toxNGLXSH(String sen) -> String` that converts an English sentence to xNGLXSH in which every lowercase vowel is replaced with 'X', each uppercase vowel is replaced with 'x', every lowercase consonant is replaced with its uppercase version, and every uppercase consonant is replaced with its lowercase version.

## Example Cases:
```
toxNGLXSH("English") => "xNGLXSH"
toxNGLXSH("hello there!") => "HXLLX THXRX!"
toxNGLXSH("My name is John!") => "mY NXMX XS jXHN!"
toxNGLXSH("To be or not to be!") => "tX BX XR NXT TX BX!"
toxNGLXSH("The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy rabbit.") => "tHX QXXCK BRXWN FXX JXMPXD XVXR THX LXZY RXBBXT."
```
</problem>
<bug_code>
1. public static String toxNGLXSH(String sen) {
2.     String[] vowels = {"a", "e", "i", "o", "u", "A", "E", "I", "O", "U"};
3.     for (String i : vowels) {
4.         if (Character.isLowerCase(i.charAt(0))) {
5.             sen.replace(i, "x");
6.         } else {
7.             sen.replace(i, "X");
8.         }
9.     }
10.    sen.swapCase();
11.    return sen;
12. }
</bug_code>
<bug_desc>
On lines 5, 7, and 10, the calls `sen.replace` and `sen.swapCase` leave `sen` unchanged, because strings are immutable in Java. Consequently, the function returns `sen` as it is.
</bug_desc>
<bug_fixes>
Replace `sen.swapCase()` with `sen = sen.swapCase()` on line 10 and on lines 5 and 7 change `sen.replace` to `sen = sen.replace`.

User: Help! I wrote a lot of code and nothing is working.
Assistant: I'm here to help. Can you describe the problem you are having?
     <alt>Can you walk me through your code line by line?
     <alt>Let's start with a simple example. What is the output of your code when you run it with the input "English"?
     <alt>What does the `.replace()` method do?
     <alt>What does the `.swapCase()` method do?
User: I wrote a lot of code that makes sense, but my input sentence isn't changing at all. It is the same sentence that I started with. What do I do?
Assistant: What are some reasons it could be staying the same?
     <alt>What does the `.replace()` method do and does it modify the original string?
     <alt>What does the `.swapCase()` method do and does it modify the original string?
User: I could have an issue in the for loop or the control flow where somehow none of the methods are actually being called. Otherwise, there might be an issue with the methods I'm using.
	<alt>If I was using the string methods incorrectly or if I was using the wrong ones, it might not work.
Assistant: Let's test each of these separately. How can you check whether the methods are being called?
User: One way I could check this is by adding `System.out.println` statements right before the methods to make sure I'm reaching those parts of the code. It looks like I'm reaching each part, but the sentence isn't changing. I think I'm not using these methods properly.
<code>
public static String toxNGLXSH(String sen) {
    String[] vowels = {"a", "e", "i", "o", "u", "A", "E", "I", "O", "U"};
    for (String i : vowels) {
        if (Character.isLowerCase(i.charAt(0))) {
            System.out.println("here1 " + sen);
            sen.replace(i, "x");
        } else {
            System.out.println("here2 " + sen);
            sen.replace(i, "X");
        }
    }
    System.out.println("here3 " + sen);
    sen.swapCase();
    return sen;
}
</code>
Assistant: Is there an easy way to modify your code to verify whether your code is modifying the original string?
     <alt>What makes you think that you are using the methods incorrectly?
     <alt>Have you considered printing the output of the method calls to see if they are changing the string, for example, `System.out.println(sen.replace(i, "x"))`?
     <alt>Have you considered assigning the output of the method calls to a variable?
     <alt>Where can you learn more about how `.replace()` and `.swapCase()` work and how they are used?
User: Hm, I guess I can just assign `sen` the output of the method calls, in case they don't do in-place changes. That works!
     <alt>I could also just print the output of the method calls to see if they are changing the string.
<code>
public static String toxNGLXSH(String sen) {
    String[] vowels = {"a", "e", "i", "o", "u", "A", "E", "I", "O", "U"};
    for (String i : vowels) {
        if (Character.isLowerCase(i.charAt(0))) {
            sen = sen.replace(i, "x");
        } else {
            sen = sen.replace(i, "X");
        }
    }
    sen = sen.swapCase();
    return sen;
}
</code>
Assistant: Great! let me know if you need more help.
