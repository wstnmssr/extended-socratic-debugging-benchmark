<problem>
Write a Python function called `get_combinations(my_list: list(str)) -> list(str)` that takes a list of distinct characters as a parameter, and returns a list containing all of the 2-letter combinations of said characters. The ordering of the elements in the list does not matter, so long as all of the 2-letter combinations are contained within the list.

## Example Cases:
```
get_combinations(['a', 'b']) => ['aa', 'ba', 'ab', 'bb']
get_combinations(['a', 'b', 'c']) => ['aa', 'ba', 'ca', 'ab', 'bb', 'cb', 'ac', 'bc', 'cc']
get_combinations(['ta', 'er', 'c']) => ['tata', 'erta', 'cta', 'taer', 'erer', 'cer', 'tac', 'erc', 'cc']
```
</problem>
<bug_code>
1. def get_combinations(list_c):
2.    ans=[]
3.    for i in range(0,len(list_c)):
4.        for j in range(i,len(list_c)):
5.            ans.append(list_c[j]+list_c[i])
6.    return ans
</bug_code>
<bug_desc>
On line 4, the second for loop starts at `i` rather than at `0`, so it is missing combinations of the i-th character with characters that precede it. 
</bug_desc>
<bug_fixes>
On line 4, change the for loop to `for j in range(len(list_c))`.

assert get_combinations(['a', 'b']) == ['aa', 'ba', 'ab', 'bb']
assert get_combinations(['a', 'b', 'c']) == ['aa', 'ba', 'ca', 'ab', 'bb', 'cb', 'ac', 'bc', 'cc']
assert get_combinations(['ta', 'er', 'c']) == ['tata', 'erta', 'cta', 'taer', 'erer', 'cer', 'tac', 'erc', 'cc']

User: Help! I'm stuck.
Assistant: Okay, let's look at the code. Tell me about what happens on line 2?
	<alt>Okay, let's go over the code. Does the first test case pass?
	<alt>Where do you think the problem is?
	<alt>Have you completed all parts of the instructions?
User: Line 2 makes an empty list that we are going to fill later.
Assistant: Yes, now let's move on to the first part of the loop. What happens on line 3?
	<alt>Where do you think the problem is?
	<alt>Do you see any problems with line 2?
User: Line 3 makes a for loop.
Assistant: What is the variable name for the iterator made on line 3?
	<alt>What controls the loop?
	<alt>How many times does the loop iterate?
	<alt>What is the role of range on line 3?
User: The iterator is named i.
Assistant: What value does i start on, and what value does it stop on?
	<alt>What determines when that loop ends?
	<alt>How many times does it iterate?
	<alt>What is range for?
User: i is supposed to start at 0 and end at the length of the list.
Assistant: Look at range, does i start and stop where it should?
	<alt>How many times does it iterate?
	<alt>What determines that the loop runs the right number of times?
User: Yes, that part looks right.
Assistant: Let's check the second loop next. Where does it start?
User: The loop starts on line 4.
Assistant: What iterator is made on that line?
	<alt>How many times should that loop iterate?
	<alt>Where in the array list should we start for the second term?
User: We make j on that line.
Assistant: How many times should that loop iterate?
	<alt>Where in the array list should we start for the second term?
	<alt>Should we go through the whole array list for the second term in the combination?
	<alt>What part of the code on that line controls the iteration of the loop?
User: It should iterate once for every item in `list_c`.
	<alt>Oh! It's starting at i not at 0!
Assistant: What value should it start at to iterate once for every item in list_c?
	<alt>What part of the code on that line controls the iteration of the loop?
	<alt>Where in the array list should we start for the second term?
User: It should start at the beginning of the list, at 0.
Assistant: What piece of the code would control that?
User: The values inside of range. Oh! I need to make it start at 0 not at i!
<code>
1. def get_combinations(list_c):
2.    ans=[]
3.    for i in range(0,len(list_c)):
4.        for j in range(0,len(list_c)):
5.            ans.append(list_c[j]+list_c[i])
6.    return ans
</code>
Assistant: Great! Now let's run the code and see if it works.
User: It works! Thank you!
